              "'Age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don\\'t mind, it doesn\\'t matter. Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young. Wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have been. True terror is to wake up one morning and discover that your high school class is running the country. A diplomat is a man who always remembers a woman\\'s birthday but never remembers her age. As I grow older, I pay less attention to what men say. I just watch what they do. How incessant and great are the ills with which a prolonged old age is replete. Old age, believe me, is a good and pleasant thing. It is true you are gently shouldered off the stage, but then you are given such a comfortable front stall as spectator. Old age has deformities enough of its own. It should never add to them the deformity of vice. Nobody grows old merely by living a number of years. We grow old by deserting our ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. An archaeologist is the best husband a woman can have. The older she gets the more interested he is in her. All diseases run into one, old age. Bashfulness is an ornament to youth, but a reproach to old age. Like everyone else who makes the mistake of getting older, I begin each day with coffee and obituaries. Age appears to be best in four things old wood best to burn, old wine to drink, old friends to trust, and old authors to read. None are so old as those who have outlived enthusiasm. Every man over forty is a scoundrel. Forty is the old age of youth fifty the youth of old age. You can\\'t help getting older, but you don\\'t have to get old. Alas, after a certain age every man is responsible for his face. Youth is when you\\'re allowed to stay up late on New Year\\'s Eve. Middle age is when you\\'re forced to. \\x0cOld age is like everything else. To make a success of it, you\\'ve got to start young. A comfortable old age is the reward of a well-spent youth. Instead of its bringing sad and melancholy prospects of decay, it would give us hopes of eternal youth in a better world. A man growing old becomes a child again. I will never be an old man. To me, old age is always 15 years older than I am. Age considers youth ventures. What most persons consider as virtue, after the age of 40 is simply a loss of energy. Age is a very high price to pay for maturity. Old age is no place for sissies. I don\\'t feel old. I don\\'t feel anything till noon. That\\'s when it\\'s time for my nap. As I approve of a youth that has something of the old man in him, so I am no less pleased with an old man that has something of the youth. He that follows this rule may be old in body, but can never be so in mind. I don\\'t believe one grows older. I think that what happens early on in life is that at a certain age one stands still and stagnates. Advice in old age is foolish for what can be more absurd than to increase our provisions for the road the nearer we approach to our journey\\'s end. When grace is joined with wrinkles, it is adorable. There is an unspeakable dawn in happy old age. It takes a long time to become young. After thirty, a body has a mind of its own. There is a fountain of youth: it is your mind, your talents, the creativity you bring to your life and the lives of people you love. When you learn to tap this source, you will truly have defeated age. Age is not a particularly interesting subject. Anyone can get old. All you have to do is live long enough. Old minds are like old horses you must exercise them if you wish to keep them in working order. Forty is the old age of youth, fifty is the youth of old age. Youth is the gift of nature, but age is a work of art. Preparation for old age should begin not later than one\\'s teens. A life which is empty of purpose until 65 will not suddenly become filled on retirement. \\x0cThere is always some specific moment when we become aware that our youth is gone but, years after, we know it was much later.  Growing old is no more than a bad habit which a busy person has no time to form. As long as any adult thinks that he, like the parents and teachers of old, can become introspective, invoking his own youth to understand the youth before him, he is lost. Old age is fifteen years older than I am. Aging is not lost youth but a new stage of opportunity and strength. The great secret that all old people share is that you really haven\\'t changed in seventy or eighty years. Your body changes, but you don\\'t change at all. And that, of course, causes great confusion. The trick is growing up without growing old. Old age comes on suddenly, and not gradually as is thought. I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. I\\'m happy to report that my inner child is still ageless. Youth is the best time to be rich, and the best time to be poor. It is sad to grow old but nice to ripen. One of the many things nobody ever tells you about middle age is that it\\'s such a nice change from being young. After you\\'re older, two things are possibly more important than any others: health and money. You end up as you deserve. In old age you must put up with the face, the friends, the health, and the children you have earned. I\\'m not interested in age. People who tell me their age are silly. You\\'re as old as you feel. Inflation is when you pay fifteen dollars for the ten- dollar haircut you used to get for five dollars when you had hair. My notion of a wife at 40 is that a man should be able to change her, like a bank note, for two 20s. As you age naturally, your family shows more and more on your face. If you deny that, you deny your heritage. Old age is like a plane flying through a storm. Once you\\'re aboard, there\\'s nothing you can do. \\x0cIn youth the days are short and the years are long. In old age the years are short and day\\'s long. The aging process has you firmly in its grasp if you never get the urge to throw a snowball.  Age is how we determine how valuable you are. Middle age is when your age starts to show around your middle. Aging seems to be the only available way to live a long life. I think when the full horror of being fifty hits you, you should stay home and have a good cry. To keep the heart unwrinkled, to be hopeful, kindly, cheerful, reverent that is to triumph over old age. If you\\'re old, don\\'t try to change yourself, change your environment. Old age is an excellent time for outrage. My goal is to say or do at least one outrageous thing every week. I want to get old gracefully. I want to have good posture, I want to be healthy and be an example to my children. You know you\\'re getting old when all the names in your black book have M. D. after them. What makes old age so sad is not that our joys but our hopes cease. Old age is a shipwreck. While one finds company in himself and his pursuits, he cannot feel old, no matter what his years may be. To resist the frigidity of old age, one must combine the body, the mind, and the heart. And to keep these in parallel vigor one must exercise, study, and love. Old age is the most unexpected of all the things that can happen to a man. No one can avoid aging, but aging productively is something else. If you haven\\'t turned rebel by twenty you\\'ve got no heart if you haven\\'t turned establishment by thirty you\\'ve got no brains! Oh rage! Oh despair! Oh age, my enemy! I don\\'t want to fight aging I want to take good care of myself, but plastic surgery and all that? I\\'m not interested. Middle age is the time when a man is always thinking that in a week or two he will feel as good as ever. \\x0cWe should so provide for old age that it may have no urgent wants of this world to absorb it from meditation on the next. It is awful to see the lean hands of dotage making a coffer of the grave. Middle age is the awkward period when Father Time starts catching up with Mother Nature. Middle age is youth without levity, and age without decay. No man is ever old enough to know better. The denunciation of the young is a necessary part of the hygiene of older people, and greatly assists the circulation of the blood. In youth we run into difficulties. In old age difficulties run into us. We pay when old for the excesses of youth. The answer to old age is to keep one\\'s mind busy and to go on with one\\'s life as if it were interminable. I always admired Chekhov for building a new house when he was dying of tuberculosis. We\\'ve put more effort into helping folks reach old age than into helping them enjoy it. The real sadness of fifty is not that you change so much but that you change so little. I\\'m not afraid of aging. He has a profound respect for old age. Especially when it\\'s bottled. Whatever poet, orator or sage may say of it, old age is still old age. To keep the heart unwrinkled, to be hopeful, kindly, cheerful, reverent - that is to triumph over old age. In old age we are like a batch of letters that someone has sent. We are no longer in the past, we have arrived. There\\'s no such thing as old age, there is only sorrow. Those who love deeply never grow old they may die of old age, but they die young. I get all fired up about aging in America. The really frightening thing about middle age is the knowledge that you\\'ll grow out of it. There is an anti-aging possibility, but it has to come from within. The lovely thing about being forty is that you can appreciate twenty-five-year- old men more. When a noble life has prepared old age, it is not decline that it reveals, but the first days of immortality. \\x0cThe whole business of marshaling one\\'s energies becomes more and more important as one grows older. The tendency of old age to the body, say the physiologists, is to form bone. It is as rare as it is pleasant to meet with an old man whose opinions are not ossified. Old age adds to the respect due to virtue, but it takes nothing from the contempt inspired by vice it whitens only the hair. As men get older, the toys get more expensive. I find that a man is as old as his work. If his work keeps him from moving forward, he will look forward with the work. Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen. Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking. Confusion of goals and perfection of means seems, in my opinion, to characterize our age. Perfection of means and confusion of ends seem to characterize our age. The age of a woman doesn\\'t mean a thing. The best tunes are played on the oldest fiddles. Life would be infinitely happier if we could only be born at the age of eighty and gradually approach eighteen. A stockbroker urged me to buy a stock that would triple its value every year. I told him, \\'At my age, I don\\'t even buy green bananas.\\' When marrying, ask yourself this question: Do you believe that you will be able to converse well with this person into your old age? Everything else in marriage is transitory. Probably the happiest period in life most frequently is in middle age, when the eager passions of youth are cooled, and the infirmities of age not yet begun as we see that the shadows, which are at morning and evening so large, almost entirely disappear at midday. Age is whatever you think it is. You are as old as you think you are. As human beings, our greatness lies not so much in being able to remake the world - that is the myth of the atomic age - as in being able to remake ourselves. \\x0cA man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. In every country and every age, the priest had been hostile to Liberty. The heresy of one age becomes the orthodoxy of the next. The golden age is before us, not behind us. Every formula of every religion has in this age of reason, to submit to the acid test of reason and universal assent. Thomas Jefferson once said, \\'We should never judge a president by his age, only by his works.\\' And ever since he told me that, I stopped worrying. No woman should ever be quite accurate about her age. It looks so calculating. At twenty years of age the will reigns at thirty, the wit and at forty, the judgment. Age does not protect you from love. But love, to some extent, protects you from age. Information is the oxygen of the modern age. It seeps through the walls topped by barbed wire, it wafts across the electrified borders. Old age is just a record of one\\'s whole life. We prefer world law in the age of self-determination to world war in the age of mass extermination. Each age, it is found, must write its own books or rather, each generation for the next succeeding. Education is the best provision for old age. The secret of staying young is to live honestly, eat slowly, and lie about your age. Sometimes I think it would be easier to avoid old age, to die young, but then you\\'d never complete your life, would you? You\\'d never wholly know you. I don\\'t think of myself as a poor deprived ghetto girl who made good. I think of myself as somebody who from an early age knew I was responsible for myself, and I had to make good. The kids are old enough now - I just want to let them be kids. I don\\'t want to comment on them too much. They\\'re at an age where I just want to let them be kids. He who is of calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure of age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are equally a burden. \\x0cWhy should society feel responsible only for the education of children, and not for the education of all adults of every age? I\\'ve got volumes on how not to behave. I\\'ve got more information now than a guy should have at my age. I\\'m at the age where food has taken the place of sex in my life. In fact, I\\'ve just had a mirror put over my kitchen table. Age is something that doesn\\'t matter, unless you are a cheese. Hesitation increases in relation to risk in equal proportion to age. Books were my pass to personal freedom. I learned to read at age three, and soon discovered there was a whole world to conquer that went beyond our farm in Mississippi. In our age there is no such thing as \\'keeping out of politics.\\' All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia. I must confess, I was born at a very early age. The secret of genius is to carry the spirit of the child into old age, which mean never losing your enthusiasm. It is utterly false and cruelly arbitrary to put all the play and learning into childhood, all the work into middle age, and all the regrets into old age. We aren\\'t in an information age, we are in an entertainment age. To me - old age is always ten years older than I am. Age is not important unless you\\'re a cheese. No matter what age you are, or what your circumstances might be, you are special, and you still have something unique to offer. Your life, because of who you are, has meaning. A woman has the age she deserves. The older I grow the more I distrust the familiar doctrine that age brings wisdom. Youngsters of the age of two and three are endowed with extraordinary strength. They can lift a dog twice their own weight and dump him into the bathtub. He who has not the spirit of this age, has all the misery of it. \\x0cInstead of being presented with stereotypes by age, sex, color, class, or religion, children must have the opportunity to learn that within each range, some people are loathsome and some are delightful. I think being able to age gracefully is a very important talent. It is too late for me. Error is acceptable as long as we are young but one must not drag it along into old age. Age wrinkles the body. Quitting wrinkles the soul. I don\\'t need you to remind me of my age. I have a bladder to do that for me. Talk is by far the most accessible of pleasures. It costs nothing in money, it is all profit, it completes our education, founds and fosters our friendships, and can be enjoyed at any age and in almost any state of health. Men of age object too much, consult too long, adventure too little, repent too soon, and seldom drive business home to the full period, but content themselves with a mediocrity of success. Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age. Age merely shows what children we remain. Each moment of a happy lover\\'s hour is worth an age of dull and common life. The credit of advancing science has always been due to individuals and never to the age. Dressing up is a bore. At a certain age, you decorate yourself to attract the opposite sex, and at a certain age, I did that. But I\\'m past that age. I was born at the age of twelve on an MGM lot. A woman telling her true age is like a buyer confiding his final price to an Armenian rug dealer. How young can you die of old age? Legend: A lie that has attained the dignity of age. Age does not protect you from love. But love, to some extent, protects you from age. Every great architect is - necessarily - a great poet. He must be a great original interpreter of his time, his day, his age. At the age of six I wanted to be a cook. At seven I wanted to be Napoleon. And my ambition has been growing steadily ever since. \\x0cMiddle age is when you\\'re sitting at home on a Saturday night and the telephone rings and you hope it isn\\'t for you. If youth knew if age could. I think the biggest disease the world suffers from in this day and age is the disease of people feeling unloved. I know that I can give love for a minute, for half an hour, for a day, for a month, but I can give. I am very happy to do that, I want to do that. The charm of history and its enigmatic lesson consist in the fact that, from age to age, nothing changes and yet everything is completely different. Men are like wine - some turn to vinegar, but the best improve with age. I created Punk for this day and age. Do you see Britney walking around wearing ties and singing punk? Hell no. That\\'s what I do. I\\'m like a Sid Vicious for a new generation. We are all geniuses up to the age of ten. It is well for the world that in most of us, by the age of thirty, the character has set like plaster, and will never soften again. Every age has its own poetry in every age the circumstances of history choose a nation, a race, a class to take up the torch by creating situations that can be expressed or transcended only through poetry. Old age is not a matter for sorrow. It is matter for thanks if we have left our work done behind us. I suppose when they reach a certain age some men are afraid to grow up. It seems the older the men get, the younger their new wives get. Sex at age 90 is like trying to shoot pool with a rope. Publishing is in a kind of Jurassic age. Age is just a number. It\\'s totally irrelevant unless, of course, you happen to be a bottle of wine. Whatever you may look like, marry a man your own age - as your beauty fades, so will his eyesight. Youth has no age. Youth is a blunder Manhood a struggle, Old Age a regret. To teach how to live without certainty and yet without being paralysed by hesitation is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy, in our age, can do for those who study it. \\x0cIt is possible that mankind is on the threshold of a golden age but, if so, it will be necessary first to slay the dragon that guards the door, and this dragon is religion. Nobody expects to trust his body overmuch after the age of fifty. Old age realizes the dreams of youth: look at Dean Swift in his youth he built an asylum for the insane, in his old age he was himself an inmate. In youth we learn in age we understand. Believe me, that was a happy age, before the days of architects, before the days of builders. I have the problems of, I must confess, old age. Not just in commerce but in the world of ideas too our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid.  Bad news isn\\'t wine. It doesn\\'t improve with age. It were a real increase of human happiness, could all young men from the age of nineteen be covered under barrels, or rendered otherwise invisible and there left to follow their lawful studies and callings, till they emerged, sadder and wiser, at the age of twenty-five. People who refuse to rest honorably on their laurels when they reach retirement age seem very admirable to me. Not to expose your true feelings to an adult seems to be instinctive from the age of seven or eight onwards. The heart never grows better by age I fear rather worse, always harder. A young liar will be an old one, and a young knave will only be a greater knave as he grows older. For age is opportunity no less Than youth itself, though in another dress, And as the evening twilight fades away The sky is filled with stars, invisible by day. Age is a case of mind over matter. If you don\\'t mind, it don\\'t matter. Have regular hours for work and play make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well. Then youth will be delightful, old age will bring few regrets, and life will become a beautiful success. \\x0cAdmiration of the proletariat, like that of dams, power stations, and aeroplanes, is part of the ideology of the machine age. But the age of chivalry is gone. That of sophisters, economists, and calculators has succeeded and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever. Childhood: the period of human life intermediate between the idiocy of infancy and the folly of youth - two removes from the sin of manhood and three from the remorse of age. Experience is a revelation in the light of which we renounce our errors of youth for those of age. My view is that at a younger age your optimism is more and you have more imagination etc. You have less bias. The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class. In the information age, you don\\'t teach philosophy as they did after feudalism. You perform it. If Aristotle were alive today he\\'d have a talk show.  Once I planned to write a book of poems entirely about the things in my pocket. But I found it would be too long and the age of the great epics is past. The harvest of old age is the recollection and abundance of blessing previously secured. It is the spirit of the age to believe that any fact, no matter how suspect, is superior to any imaginative exercise, no matter how true. The arrogance of age must submit to be taught by youth. The biggest disease this day and age is that of people feeling unloved. Old age: the crown of life, our play\\'s last act. I think women should start to embrace their age. What\\'s the alternative to getting older? You die. I can\\'t change the day I was born. But I can take care of my skin, my body, my mind, and try to live my life and be happy. Age is getting to know all the ways the world turns, so that if you cannot turn the world the way you want, you can at least get out of the way so you won\\'t get run over. Few women, I fear, have had such reason as I have to think the long sad years of youth were worth living for the sake of middle age. \\x0cOne crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name. Wives are young men\\'s mistresses, companions for middle age, and old men\\'s nurses. Wisdom doesn\\'t necessarily come with age. Sometimes age just shows up all by itself. It is a blessed thing that in every age some one has had the individuality enough and courage enough to stand by his own convictions. And in my own life, in my own small way, I\\'ve tried to give back to this country that has given me so much. That\\'s why I left a job at a law firm for a career in public service, working to empower young people to volunteer in their communities. Because I believe that each of us - no matter what our age or background or walk of life - each of us has something to contribute to the life of this nation. No lying knight or lying priest ever prospered in any age, but especially not in the dark ones. Men prospered then only in following an openly declared purpose, and preaching candidly beloved and trusted creeds.  A man does not die of love or his liver or even of old age he dies of being a man. It is with an old love as it is with old age a man lives to all the miseries, but is dead to all the pleasures. I cried on my 18th birthday. I thought 17 was such a nice age. You\\'re young enough to get away with things, but you\\'re old enough, too. We live in an age when to be young and to be indifferent can be no longer synonymous. We must prepare for the coming hour. The claims of the Future are represented by suffering millions and the Youth of a Nation are the trustees of Posterity. Age shouldn\\'t affect you. It\\'s just like the size of your shoes - they don\\'t determine how you live your life! You\\'re either marvellous or you\\'re boring, regardless of your age. Rashness belongs to youth prudence to old age. Many believe - and I believe - that I have been designated for this work by God. In spite of my old age, I do not want to give it up I work out of love for God and I put all my hope in Him. \\x0cOld age is a tyrant, who forbids, under pain of death, the pleasures of youth. The defects of the mind, like those of the face, grow worse with age. The enemy of society is middle class and the enemy of life is middle age. Some say that the age of chivalry is past, that the spirit of romance is dead. The age of chivalry is never past, so long as there is a wrong left unredressed on earth. Man has no Body distinct from his Soul for that called Body is a portion of Soul discerned by the five Senses, the chief inlets of Soul in this age. Do you remember when you were 10 or 11 years old and you really thought your folks were the best? They were completely omniscient and you took their word for everything. And then you got older and you went through this hideous age when suddenly they were the devil, they were bullies, and they didn\\'t know anything. This is the patent age of new inventions for killing bodies, and for saving souls. All propagated with the best intentions. The mind that is wise mourns less for what age takes away than what it leaves behind. The age of chivalry is past. Bores have succeeded to dragons. Anything you cannot relinquish when it has outlived its usefulness possesses you, and in this materialistic age a great many of us are possessed by our possessions. Like many women my age, I am 28 years old. Life, an age to the miserable, and a moment to the happy. We are always the same age inside. I am, as I\\'ve said, merely competent. But in an age of incompetence, that makes me extraordinary. Swing voters are more appropriately known as the \\'idiot voters\\' because they have no set of philosophical principles. By the age of fourteen, you\\'re either a Conservative or a Liberal if you have an IQ above a toaster. If you live to be one hundred, you\\'ve got it made. Very few people die past that age. \\x0cOld age is far more than white hair, wrinkles, the feeling that it is too late and the game finished, that the stage belongs to the rising generations. The true evil is not the weakening of the body, but the indifference of the soul. Old age has its pleasures, which, though different, are not less than the pleasures of youth. Old age is when the liver spots show through your gloves. There is no absurdity so palpable but that it may be firmly planted in the human head if you only begin to inculcate it before the age of five, by constantly repeating it with an air of great solemnity. Those who improve with age embrace the power of personal growth and personal achievement and begin to replace youth with wisdom, innocence with understanding, and lack of purpose with self- actualization. Nearly all the powerful people of this age are unbelievers, the best of them in doubt and misery, the most in plodding hesitation, doing as well as they can, what practical work lies at hand. What is an adult? A child blown up by age. Intelligent life on a planet comes of age when it first works out the reason for its own existence. I am of a healthy long lived race, and our minds improve with age. The wisdom of age: don\\'t stop walking. As the age of television progresses the Reagans will be the rule, not the exception. To be perfect for television is all a President has to be these days. Before anything else, we need a new age of Enlightenment. Our present political systems must relinquish their claims on truth, justice and freedom and have to replace them with the search for truth, justice, freedom and reason.

I\\'m 36 and if I met a woman of my own age and married her, I\\'d also be marrying her former life, her past. It might be OK for some people - I don\\'t want to judge it or anything - but it\\'s not for me. It would destroy my creativity. \\x0cI believe we should encourage children to sing and play instruments from an early age. You should not consider a man\\'s age but his acts. At my age flowers scare me. I would go out with women my age, but there are no women my age. It is not well to make great changes in old age. Setting a good example for your children takes all the fun out of middle age. You are 27 or 28 right? It is very tough to live at that age. When nothing is sure. I have sympathy with you. The stars shall fade away, the sun himself Grow dim with age, and nature sink in years, But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth, Unhurt amidst the wars of elements, The wrecks of matter, and the crush of worlds. Young men soon give, and soon forget, affronts old age is slow in both. By all but the pathologically romantic, it is now recognized that this is not the age of the small man. It is not the young people that degenerate they are not spoiled till those of mature age are already sunk into corruption. To be happy, we must be true to nature and carry our age along with us. Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young. It is the malady of our age that the young are so busy teaching us that they have no time left to learn. I\\'m at peace with myself and where I am. In the past, I was always looking to see how everybody else was doing. I wasn\\'t competitive, I was comparative. I just wanted to be where everybody else was. Now I\\'ve gotten to an age when I am not comparing anymore. We of Africa protest that, in this day and age, we should continue to be treated as lesser human beings than other races. Marriage is not about age it\\'s about finding the right person. We have entered an age in which education is not just a luxury permitting some men an advantage over others. It has become a necessity without which a person is defenseless in this complex, industrialized society. We have truly entered the century of the educated man. Old age is the verdict of life. \\x0cThe passions grafted on wounded pride are the most inveterate they are green and vigorous in old age. Every age can be enchanting, provided you live within it. It is unthinkable for a Frenchman to arrive at middle age without having syphilis and the Cross of the Legion of Honor. It is folly for an eminent man to think of escaping censure, and a weakness to be affected with it. All the illustrious persons of antiquity, and indeed of every age in the world, have passed through this fiery persecution. There must be a day or two in a man\\'s life when he is the precise age for something important. It is old age, rather than death, that is to be contrasted with life. Old age is life\\'s parody, whereas death transforms life into a destiny: in a way it preserves it by giving it the absolute dimension. Death does away with time. I don\\'t care about age very much. Old age and the passage of time teach all things. I think age is a very high price to pay for maturity. I had used eclectic therapy and behavior therapy on myself at the age of 19 to get over my fear of public speaking and of approaching young women in public. Children rarely want to know who their parents were before they were parents, and when age finally stirs their curiosity, there is no parent left to tell them. Middle age occurs when you are too young to take up golf and too old to rush up to the net. Old age: I fall asleep during the funerals of my friends. Staid middle age loves the hurricane passions of opera. Middle age went by while I was mourning for my lost youth. In passing, we should note this curious mark of our own age: the only absolute allowed is the absolute insistence that there is no absolute. It\\'s not catastrophes, murders, deaths, diseases, that age and kill us it\\'s the way people look and laugh, and run up the steps of omnibuses. Not even old age knows how to love death. \\x0cIt\\'s really amazing that in the age of unbelief, as a smart man called it, there isn\\'t even more fraud. After all, with no God, there\\'s no one to ever call you to account, and no accounting at all if you can get away with it. I think that a man should not live beyond the age when he begins to deteriorate, when the flame that lighted the brightest moment of his life has weakened. Temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edged tool that grows keener with constant use. It is not by the gray of the hair that one knows the age of the heart. I think the sport of wrestling, which I became involved with at the age of 14... I competed until I was 34, kind of old for a contact sport. I coached the sport until I was 47. I think the discipline of wrestling has given me the discipline I have to write. Another belief of mine that everyone else my age is an adult, whereas I am merely in disguise. Age carries all things away, even the mind. Age steals away all things, even the mind. In fact, my courage and my bravery at a young age was the thing I was bullied for, a kind of \\'Who do you think you are?\\' A bad manner spoils everything, even reason and justice a good one supplies everything, gilds a No, sweetens a truth, and adds a touch of beauty to old age itself. As technology advances, it reverses the characteristics of every situation again and again. The age of automation is going to be the age of \\'do it yourself.\\' The excess of our youth are checks written against our age and they are payable with interest thirty years later. At the age when Bengali youth almost inevitably writes poetry, I was listening to European classical music. I smoke ten to fifteen cigars a day. At my age I have to hold on to something. I\\'m at the age now where just putting my cigar in its holder is a thrill. Age becomes reality when you hear someone refer to that attractive young woman standing next to the woman in the green dress, and you find that you\\'re the one in the green dress. \\x0cOur scientific age demands that we provide definitions, measurements, and statistics in order to be taken seriously. Yet most of the important things in life cannot be precisely defined or measured. Can we define or measure love, beauty, friendship, or decency, for example? The nearer people approach old age the closer they return to a semblance of childhood, until the time comes for them to depart this life, again like children, neither tired of living nor aware of death. Old age is a special problem for me because I\\'ve never been able to shed the mental image I have of myself - a lad of about 19. People until I was 60 would always say they thought I looked younger, which I think, without flattering myself, I did, but I think I certainly have, as George Orwell says people do after a certain age, the face they deserve. The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender, religion or ethnic background, is that we all believe we are above-average drivers. Why do people talk of the horrors of old age? It\\'s great. I feel like a fine old car with the parts gradually wearing out, but I\\'m not complaining,... Those who find growing old terrible are people who haven\\'t done what they wanted with their lives. As winter strips the leaves from around us, so that we may see the distant regions they formerly concealed, so old age takes away our enjoyments only to enlarge the prospect of the coming eternity. God employs several translators some pieces are translated by age, some by sickness, some by war, some by justice. No man was ever so completely skilled in the conduct of life, as not to receive new information from age and experience. Interest is the spur of the people, but glory that of great souls. Invention is the talent of youth, and judgment of age. Invention is the talent of youth, as judgment is of age. I\\'m very pleased to be here. Let\\'s face it, at my age I\\'m very pleased to be anywhere. \\x0cI must be more sensible and realize that at my age, illusions are hardly permitted and they will always destroy me. My age and health will never allow me to realize the dream of art I\\'ve been pursuing all my life. My husband gave me a necklace. It\\'s fake. I requested fake. Maybe I\\'m paranoid, but in this day and age, I don\\'t want something around my neck that\\'s worth more than my head. From as long as, literally as far back as I can remember I\\'ve liked puns, word jokes, I can literally recall looking at a comic at the age of six or seven and I remember what I enjoyed and what it was precisely and how the joke worked. The terror of the atom age is not the violence of the new power but the speed of man\\'s adjustment to it, the speed of his acceptance. I was born in ancient times, at the end of the world, in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family. No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist - although the term had not reached Chile yet, so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me. The information encoded in your DNA determines your unique biological characteristics, such as sex, eye color, age and Social Security number. O love, if I regret the age when one savors you, it is not for the hour of pleasure, but for the one that follows it. In the television age, the key distinction is between the candidate who can speak poetry and the one who can only speak prose. Age does not matter if the matter does not age. I\\'m well past the age where I\\'m acceptable. You get to a certain age and you are forbidden access. You\\'re not going to get the kind of coverage that you would like in music magazines, you\\'re not going to get played on radio and you\\'re not going to get played on television. I have to survive on word of mouth. Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse to take it tragically. Ours is an excessively conscious age. We know so much, we feel so little. \\x0cEverybody past a certain age, regardless of how they look on the outside, pretty much constantly dreams of being able to escape from their lives. One keeps forgetting old age up to the very brink of the grave. In the age of the individual\\'s liquidation, the question of individuality must be raised anew. I ask you to pray for me, for once age has overtaken us, we find consolation only in religion. Today more than ever we need creative minds to address the issues of the age. And one of the most urgent is this: How can humanity know so much, achieve so much, and still fail so many people so badly? Women lie about their age men lie about their income. A major advantage of age is learning to accept people without passing judgment. The people who live in a golden age usually go around complaining how yellow everything looks. There was no respect for youth when I was young, and now that I am old, there is no respect for age, I missed it coming and going. Everyone knows that by far the happiest and universally enjoyable age of man is the first. What is there about babies which makes us hug and kiss and fondle them, so that even an enemy would give them help at that age? Well, I\\'m in my 60s now. I finally look it, I think. People until I was 60 would always say they thought I looked younger, which I think, without flattering myself, I did, but I think I certainly have, as George Orwell says people do after a certain age, the face they deserve.

Save your money. You\\'re going to need twice as much money in your old age as you think. \\x0cIf you read back in the Bible, the letter of the apostle Paul to the church of Thessalonia, he said that in the latter days before the end of the age that the Earth would be caught up in what he called the birth pangs of a new order. There is no self-knowledge but an historical one. No one knows what he himself is who does not know his fellow men, especially the most prominent one of the community, the master\\'s master, the genius of the age. Middle age is when your old classmates are so grey and wrinkled and bald they don\\'t recognize you. In this electronic age we see ourselves being translated more and more into the form of information, moving toward the technological extension of consciousness. You can judge your age by the amount of pain you feel when you come in contact with a new idea. The sanitary and mechanical age we are now entering makes up for the mercy it grants to our sense of smell by the ferocity with which it assails our sense of hearing. Middle age is when you\\'ve met so many people that every new person you meet reminds you of someone else. There are people whose watch stops at a certain hour and who remain permanently at that age. My justification is that most people my age spend a lot of time thinking about what they\\'re going to do for the next five or ten years. The time they spend thinking about their life, I just spend drinking. They that have lived a single day have lived an age. From the age of fifteen, dogma has been the fundamental principle of my religion: I know no other religion I cannot enter into the idea of any other sort of religion religion, as a mere sentiment, is to me a dream and a mockery. The class distinctions proper to a democratic society are not those of rank or money, still less, as is apt to happen when these are abandoned, of race, but of age. Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the universe, old age flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of death. \\x0cWe are living in the machine age. For the first time in history the comedian has been compelled to supply himself with jokes and comedy material to compete with the machine. Whether he knows it or not, the comedian is on a treadmill to oblivion. At a certain age it just became apparent to me that this was probably the work that I would have to do. Genius is present in every age, but the men carrying it within them remain benumbed unless extraordinary events occur to heat up and melt the mass so that it flows forth. Every age needs men who will redeem the time by living with a vision of the things that are to be. I would like to see more airplay for all artists, no matter what age. I think there\\'s a lot of money being spent toward the young guys, but a lot of the older guys are the ones who blazed the trail for those young guys. In my old age, I\\'ll be in L.A. I shall not grow conservative with age. I first learned that there were black people living in some place called other than the United States in the western hemisphere when I was a very little boy, and my father told me that when he was a boy about my age, he wanted to be an Episcopal priest, because he so admired his priest, a black man from someplace called Haiti. Why should 20-year-olds only be considered sexy? I think we get better with age. I saw how many people were poor and how many kids my age went to school hungry in the morning, which I don\\'t think most of my contemporaries in racially segregated schools in the South thought very much about at the time. When you get to my age life seems little more than one long march to and from the lavatory. I think, if you put a camera in anyone\\'s life and document it daily from the age of 21 to 27, there are going to be things that aren\\'t always pretty. Non-disclosure in the Internet Age is quickly perceived as a breach of trust. Government, corporations and each of us as individuals must recalibrate how we live and share our lives appropriate to the information now available and the expectations of others. \\x0cWhere children are, there is the golden age. Sure I played, did you think I was born at the age of 70 sitting in a dugout trying to manage guys like you? To be free in an age like ours, one must be in a position of authority. That in itself would be enough to make me ambitious. I came to water late. I learned to swim at the age of 20. People are so busy dreaming the American Dream, fantasizing about what they could be or have a right to be, that they\\'re all asleep at the switch. Consequently we are living in the Age of Human Error. I was getting hot flashes and sweats on a regular basis. That\\'s not normal, even for my age. I remember at the age of five travelling on a trolley car with my mother past a group of women on a picket line at a textile plant, seeing them being viciously beaten by security people. So that kind of thing stayed with me. Age is not all decay it is the ripening, the swelling, of the fresh life within, that withers and bursts the husk. I knew at a young age, whether I was playing baseball or hockey or lacrosse, that my teammates were counting on me, whether it be to strike the last batter out in a baseball game or score a big goal in a hockey game. The funniest racism is the racism between minorities. It\\'s something you don\\'t see dramatized, but almost every minority I know who\\'s my age, they have these funny stories about their parents stereotyping other minorities. It\\'s ironic that at age 32, at probably the greatest moment of my career, with The Godfather having such an enormous success, I wasn\\'t even aware of it, because I was somewhere else under the deadline again. I\\'m asked all the time in interviews about who I am, and I know a few people my age who have a strong sense of self, but I couldn\\'t say I know myself and sum it up and give it to you in a little package. I don\\'t know myself at all yet. Alexander at the head of the world never tasted the true pleasure that boys of his own age have enjoyed at the head of a school. \\x0cTo separate children from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone. In an age of incompetence, I\\'ve been able to last in this crazy business. I actually know how to play my ax and write a song. That\\'s my job. In this age of media and Internet access, we are much more talkative than ever before. Over the years Woodstock got glorified and romanticised and became the event that symbolised Utopia. It\\'s the last page of our collective memory of the age of innocence. Then things turned ugly and would never be the same again. Every time I see something terrible, it\\'s like I see it at age 19. I keep a freshness that way. I hate to mention age, but I come from an era when we weren\\'t consumed by technology and television. We are approaching a new age of synthesis. Knowledge cannot be merely a degree or a skill... it demands a broader vision, capabilities in critical thinking and logical deduction without which we cannot have constructive progress. Morality comes with the sad wisdom of age, when the sense of curiosity has withered. Every age yearns for a more beautiful world. The deeper the desperation and the depression about the confusing present, the more intense that yearning. To be told that one can be dependent on one\\'s parents until age 26 should strike a young person who wants to grow up as demeaning, not as something to celebrate. Does age matter? Time doesn\\'t matter. I figured out it was a social thing, what women were allowed to do. At a very young age, I decided I was not going to follow women\\'s rules. We were really grown up for our age and it was an incredible special band. Age is the first limitation on roles that I\\'ve ever had to encounter, and I hit that awhile ago. I can\\'t hit on women in public any more. I didn\\'t decide this it just doesn\\'t feel right at my age. \\x0cThis is the first age that\\'s ever paid much attention to the future, which is a little ironic since we may not have one. I feel we live in the kind of culture now where you have to be very smart to navigate the right way, and I just don\\'t have those smarts. I think with age and time it will change, but I can\\'t obsess about it. The secret of long life is double careers. One to about age sixty, then another for the next thirty years. I knew at an early age I wanted to act. Acting was always easy for me. I don\\'t believe in predestination, but I do believe that once you get where ever it is you are going, that is where you were going to be. The age in which we live, this non-stop distraction, is making it more impossible for the young generation to ever have the curiosity or discipline... because you need to be alone to find out anything. I can feel the 60S looming. In my profession, I\\'ve just moved along with my age. By thinking in decades, rather than whether someone\\'s 42 or 47, you can give yourself a whole 10 years to turn yourself around in. We all know now that people can look good for their age. It isn\\'t so extraordinary, I don\\'t know why people go on about it so much. A lot of music you might listen to is pretty vapid, it doesn\\'t always deal with our deeper issues. These are the things I\\'m interested in now, particularly at my age. Life expectancy in many parts of Africa can be something around the age of thirty five to thirty eight. I mean you\\'re very fortunate if you live to that age. In fact when I went to Uganda for the first time one of the things that occurred to me was that I saw very few elderly people. Light and funny has a more compelling quality when you\\'re younger. But I haven\\'t abandoned the genre: I love falling down I love Lucille Ball. It\\'s just that a lot of those stories revolve around problems that I can\\'t convincingly portray at this age. \\x0cI had the good fortune to be able to right an injustice that I thought was being heaped on young people by lowering the voting age, where you had young people that were old enough to die in Vietnam but not old enough to vote for their members of Congress that sent them there. The value of old age depends upon the person who reaches it. To some men of early performance it is useless. To others, who are late to develop, it just enables them to finish the job. I\\'ve gotten crankier in my old age. I\\'ve been very competitive by nature from a young age, whether it was eating a bowl of pasta faster than somebody else, or always wanting to be the first one in line. Death comes not to the living soul, nor age to the loving heart. I\\'m not busy... a woman with three children under the age of 10 wouldn\\'t think my schedule looked so busy. High expectations weren\\'t nurtured in my neck of nowhere back then - children weren\\'t fawned over from an early age as \\'gifted\\' and groomed for a prizewinning future self-esteem was considered something you had to pick from the garden yourself. Not by age but by capacity is wisdom acquired. Whoever marries the spirit of this age will find himself a widower in the next. Of middle age the best that can be said is that a middle- aged person has likely learned how to have a little fun in spite of his troubles. Old age is always wakeful as if, the longer linked with life, the less man has to do with aught that looks like death. What I think is amazing is not that 85% of people who get married under the age of 25 get divorced, it\\'s that 15% of them stay together. How did they manage to pull that off? You almost can\\'t wait too long. It\\'s the single simplest measure to predict divorce. I avoid talking before the youth of the age as I would dancing before them: for if one\\'s tongue don\\'t move in the steps of the day, and thinks to please by its old graces, it is only an object of ridicule. \\x0cI\\'m glad I was born when I was. My time was the golden age of variety. If I were starting out again now, maybe things would happen for me, but it certainly would not be on a variety show with 28 musicians, 12 dancers, two major guest stars, 50 costumes a week by Bob Mackie. The networks just wouldn\\'t spend the money today. I was taught from a young age that many people would treat me as a second-class citizen because I was African- American and because I was female. Even from a very early age, I knew I didn\\'t want to miss out on anything life had to offer just because it might be considered dangerous. We live in an age where anonymity is growing in magnitude like a bomb going off. I was a mixture of being incredibly old for my age and incredibly backwards. I was born quite old, but then I stopped growing. I lived with my mum and dad till I was 30. The Word of fire burns today On the lips of our prophets in an evil age. What is wrong with the Iranians in addition to the nuclear bomb? This is the only country on Earth in the 21st century that has renewed imperialistic ambitions. They really want to become the hegemon of the Middle East in an age that gave up imperialism. I think it\\'s quite extraordinary that people cast me as if I\\'m Warren Beatty: until I met my present wife, at the age of 35, you could name two girlfriends. Craziest thing I\\'ve done for love is getting married. I think it\\'s crazy. I think it\\'s crazy, crazy, crazy. I\\'m never going to say I wouldn\\'t do it again but I have to make sure it\\'s love and not settling for the \\'I have to do this by a certain age,\\' which is kind of what I did. You never choose the way that you\\'re raised, it\\'s just the way that you were raised, but you do get to a certain age where you\\'re in a position to question the expectations of you and the way that you\\'ve been formed by your surroundings. We tried not to age, but time had its rage. I want to age with some dignity. \\x0cThis is my 20th year in the sport. I\\'ve known swimming and that\\'s it. I don\\'t want to swim past age 30 if I continue after this Olympics, and come back in 2016, I\\'ll be 31. I\\'m looking forward to being able to see the other side of the fence. Young man, the secret of my success is that an early age I discovered that I was not God. I\\'d like to talk about free markets. Information in the computer age is the last genuine free market left on earth except those free markets where indigenous people are still surviving. And that\\'s basically becoming limited. I would often find myself, at the age of 21, at midnight, running down a dark street on my own with 10 men chasing me. And the fact they had cameras in their hands made that legal. Bring a wife home to your house when you are of the right age, not far short of 30 years, nor much above this is the right time for marriage. There are only two things a child will share willingly communicable diseases and its mother\\'s age. Although it is generally known, I think it\\'s about time to announce that I was born at a very early age. I think it\\'s your mental attitude. So many of us start dreading age in high school and that\\'s a waste of a lovely life. \\'Oh... I\\'m 30, oh, I\\'m 40, oh, 50.\\' Make the most of it. No, no, I was only funny on stage, really. I, I, think I was funny as a person toward my classmates when I was very young. You know, when I was a child, up to about the age of 12. What goes on in Europe concerns us greatly because, if Europe comes apart, the E.U. comes apart, then you\\'re going to have enormous impact on America, that\\'s a very big trading partner of ours, and people own securities around the world in this day and age. Your body actually reminds you about your age and your injuries - the body has a stronger memory than your mind. People dance at any age. I never had little brothers, so I was totally not used to hearing a lot of cussing at a young age! I learned what \\'pull my finger\\' meant the hard way. \\x0cMy sister and I shared a bedroom our entire lives and I believe she discovered the Beatles when she was about 11 and I\\'m four years younger. So from the age of 7 until 17 we had nothing but Beatles paraphernalia in our room, even those little stuffed Beatles that went on stands that are dressed as the Sgt. Pepper band. But look, I was born in 1956, the peak year for births in US history. I think I\\'m very representative of many of the thought processes my generation have been through and, by and large, people of my age have had their imprint planted on the consciousness of western society for a long time. I basically get stereotyped a lot in terms of being a girl and writing \\'chick\\' music for teenage girls or something. I think, if anything, the press kind of, because of my gender and my age, tends to kind of relegate my work to this sort of special-interest group. It\\'s part of the cultural dynamic, I guess. What is amazing for a woman of my age is that I change as the world is changing-and changing very, very fast. I don\\'t think my mother had that opportunity to change. I\\'ve never worried about age. To me age is a number, just a number. Who cares? If you\\'re extremely, painfully frightened of age, it shows. For a man who has compared himself to Theodore Roosevelt and the nation\\'s challenges to those of the Gilded Age, Obama put forward a tepid agenda. I wrote a screenplay for a \\'Sweet Valley High\\' adaptation, and it\\'s really amazing to me how many women who are my age have responded to the idea and are excited about the movie. Let age, not envy, draw wrinkles on thy cheeks. Here\\'s my Golden Rule for a tarnished age: Be fair with others, but keep after them until they\\'re fair with you. Children under five are the poorest age group in America, and one in four infants, toddlers and preschoolers are poor during the years of greatest brain development. Everyone talks about age, but it\\'s not about age. It\\'s about work ethic. Winning never gets old. \\x0cAge is a terrible avenger. The lessons of life give you so much to work with, but by the time you\\'ve got all this great wisdom, you don\\'t get to be young anymore. Science cannot tell theology how to construct a doctrine of creation, but you can\\'t construct a doctrine of creation without taking account of the age of the universe and the evolutionary character of cosmic history. I came of age believing that, no matter what happened, I would always be able to support myself.  Dallas\\' hit a chord back in the late Seventies and Eighties because it was the age of greed: here you have this unapologetic character who is mean and nasty and ruthless and does it all with an evil grin. I think people related to JR back then because we all have someone we know exactly like him. Everyone in the world knows a JR.;Larry Hagman;age 586;I\\'ve never been more in love with anyone nearly half my age than I am today.

Work out! Old age is coming! It is not classified as a pagan religion. The so-called New Age activities and this are not called religions and therefore don\\'t come under the prohibition of mingling church and state that we have in this country. No sex, age, or condition is above or below the absolute necessity of modesty but without it one vastly beneath the rank of man. People tend to become more emotionally intelligent as they age and mature. With age, you get to a place where you don\\'t want to knock people out. You just want to give people a hug. Age is no barrier. It\\'s a limitation you put on your mind. \\x0cWhoever, fleeing marriage and the sorrows that women cause, does not wish to wed comes to a deadly old age. Age has been the perfect fire extinguisher for flaming youth. I prefer younger men. In some ways, they are much more open to a woman being stronger and independent then some of the men my age. You have to be desirable. And that\\'s why so many woman of my age or even younger are pushed to Botox and plastic surgery, all the things that people say, \\'Why do women do this?\\' Where do you go in your 50s in your career? It is my art. I am better at it than I ever was. And I will do it as long as I can. When you reach a certain age you can slough off what is unnecessary and concentrate on what is. And why not? I feel like a lot of the female relationships I see on TV or in movies are in some way free of the kind of jealousy and anxiety and posturing that has been such a huge part of my female friendships, which I hope lessens a little bit with age. At my age, no one is married, no one has kids, no one has a career. One of the many pleasures of old age is giving things up. There\\'s also some element of coming of age during the Reagan administration, which everybody has painted as some glorious time in America, but I remember as being a very, very dark time. There was apocalypse in the air the punk rock movement made sense. If you explode onto the scene at a very young age, there are so many people pulling you in different directions. It takes time to recalibrate and see what\\'s important. Situational unawareness in the private marketplace or on the battlefield will cost you your livelihood or your life. In the Age of Obama, however, such willful ignorance is a job prerequisite. The less you know the better. We virtually never feel our age, but thinking that we should can lead to disaster. We grew up in a very creative environment and were exposed to the arts at a very young age, so it\\'s not a surprise that all of us are in some form of the arts. \\x0cI want to be part of the resurgence of things that are tangible, beautiful and soulful, rather than just give in to the digital age. But when I talk to people about this they just say, \\'Yeah, I know what you mean,\\' and stare at their mobiles. I wanted to do two things when I was growing up, about your age. I wanted to play in the NBA, and I wanted to be a businessman after my basketball career was over, and that is what I am doing now. The idea of regretting not doing this seemed insane to me. Sitting in the corner at a bar at age 60, saying: \\'I could\\'ve been Bond. Buy me a drink.\\' That\\'s the saddest place I could be. At least now at 60 I can say: \\'I was Bond. Now buy me a drink.\\' There\\'s a vintage which comes with age and experience. It\\'s not the normal way to look at things but I experienced death at a really young age and because of that it\\'s been part of my mental landscape that death is really very possible. I\\'ve an enormous respect for my mother who at the age of 39 raised three children, and I grew up with my grandmother in the household. And so it was a really strong household of women - my poor brother! It was great growing up with so many generations of women. Every age develops its own peculiar forms of pathology, which express in exaggerated form its underlying character structure. I love my kids, and the moments I have with them, and it\\'s kind of weird, it\\'s such an age old cliche, but the way that my sons, the way they make me feel when I look at them, the way they say things, no one else would probably react to them, but it\\'s a special thing for me. There\\'s a very small group of elite actresses who are my age, who people want to work with. It\\'s not easy to get a good job with good actors. A final word: I am not knowledgeable about the internet. I do not have a computer. I guess that at 74 years of age, I don\\'t have the patience to learn. It lies in human nature that where you experience your first laughs, you also remember the age kindly. We tried not to age, but time had its rage. \\x0cMichelle Pfeiffer hasn\\'t been finding a lot of work recently because she doesn\\'t like what a woman her age is offered. That\\'s a real double standard. You get Sean Connery, who gets older and older, still playing opposite young ladies, but it doesn\\'t work the other way around. Old age and treachery will always beat youth and exuberance. My wife and I, unlike many intellectuals, spent five years working on assembly lines. We came to fully understand the criticisms of the industrial age, in which you are an appendage of a machine that sets the pace. Even one voice can be heard loudly all over the world in this day and age. At this age, I should be leading a quiet life. Any new financial order for the world must tackle the three chief challenges of our age. There are signs that the age of petroleum has passed its zenith. Adjusted for inflation, a barrel of crude oil now sells for three times its long-run average. The large western oil companies, which cartellised the industry for much of the 20th century, are now selling more oil than they find, and are thus in the throes of liquidation. With the song \\'This Christmas\\' I wanted to do something that was kind of different. I mean, Donny Hathaway is an amazing artist. So I wanted to bring my flavor to the song so when people over the age of 45 or 50 hear it they\\'ll be like \\'OK, he did his thing with that record.\\' It\\'s like I can appeal to everybody and not just a younger demographic. In an age when the fashion is to be in love with yourself, confessing to be in love with somebody else is an admission of unfaithfulness to one\\'s beloved. Rereading A.J. Liebling carries me happily back to an age when all good journalists knew they had plenty to be modest about, and were. Reason is a crutch for age, but youth is strong enough to walk alone. What\\'s a man\\'s age? He must hurry more, that\\'s all Cram in a day, what his youth took a year to hold. What Youth deemed crystal, Age finds out was dew. A face to lose youth for, to occupy age With the dream of, meet death with. \\x0cI believe the true function of age is memory. I\\'m recording as fast as I can. So Harry Potter came in and it is nice that I have kids of the right age. I took them to London and they walked around the set and met Harry Potter and that is thrilling. All we can do when we think of kids today is think of more hours of school, earlier age at the computer, and curfews. Who would want to grow up in that world? The reason for the sadness of this modern age and the men who live in it is that it looks for the truth in everything and finds it. No, but way before that, I\\'ve been doing little dances in movies for years. Yeah, that was an amazing chance. You know, at my age to be able to do a music dance video, very unusual. There probably aren\\'t a lot of actors my age who tap dance. I started auditioning when I was about 10 and I didn\\'t get my first job until I was 12, and two years at that age is really hard. I remember being in Hollywood at the age of 16 and marveling at the stars. The idea of being part of it never entered my mind. It was too far-fetched. The older generation had greater respect for land than science. But we live in an age when science, more than soil, has become the provider of growth and abundance. Living just on the land creates loneliness in an age of globality. One of my grandfathers, actually, having gone out there as a minister, decided he would better serve the people as a doctor. So at a very late age - at the age of 38 in fact - he changed course and decided to become a doctor. I\\'m totally into new age and self-help books. I used to work in a bookstore and that\\'s the section they gave me, and I got way into it. I just loved the power of positive thinking, letting yourself go. It\\'s the kind of clothes that mothers and daughters can wear, in terms of concept... It\\'s not about age. It\\'s about taste, and it\\'s about lifestyle. I believe women of all ages can wear anything. \\x0cThe reason for the slow progress of the world seems to lie in a single fact. Every man is born under the yoke, and grows up beneath the oppressions of his age. A newspaper is lumber made malleable. It is ink made into words and pictures. It is conceived, born, grows up and dies of old age in a day. Just as we reject racism, sexism, ageism, and heterosexism, we reject speciesism. The species of a sentient being is no more reason to deny the protection of this basic right than race, sex, age, or sexual orientation is a reason to deny membership in the human moral community to other humans. I am a grandmother now, and that means age is creeping on, creeping on. I love things that age well - things that don\\'t date, that stand the test of time and that become living examples of the absolute best. Many women my age have known the experience of giving up crucial parts of themselves to please the man they love. American Idol transcends age, gender, ethnicity, everything. You get to a certain age and you can\\'t judge yourself on your dad or your parents. I\\'d like to look like Madonna when I\\'m her age. I also look at athletes and love their bodies. I\\'ve always wanted to be muscly, not skinny. A lot of women yo-yo around, but I\\'m always aware if I\\'m getting a bit out of shape. I never look at the scales but I can just tell. It goes on my tum and bum. I could always sing, from a really young age, but my voice was really weird. I used to make my mum turn up the radio every day in our house. She was well into music so I got that from her. I think women get caught up too much in having a plan - \\'I\\'m going to get married at this age I\\'m going to have a kid at this age\\' - and then they just try to find a guy who will fit into that picture. I don\\'t want my life to be based on that. I was always concerned with writing to my age at a particular moment. That was the way I would keep faith with the audience that supported me as I went along. \\x0cExperts tell us that 90% of all brain development occurs by the age of five. If we don\\'t begin thinking about education in the early years, our children are at risk of falling behind by the time they start Kindergarten. When I was seventeen, I worked as a counsellor at a co-ed sleep-away camp for eight weeks. I loved it but it could be harrowing - it was far too much responsibility for someone my age. Music has always been my protection against the world, from a very young age. I feel safe inside of a jam. We are the children of a technological age. We have found streamlined ways of doing much of our routine work. Printing is no longer the only way of reproducing books. Reading them, however, has not changed. Religion is the best antidote to the individualism of the consumer age. The idea that society can do without it flies in the face of history and, now, evolutionary biology. Religiosity turns out to be the best indicator of civic involvement: it\\'s more accurate than education, age, income, gender or race. The year I was born, 1956, was the peak year for babies being born, and there are more people essentially our age than anybody else. We could crush these new generations if we decided too. Adulthood is the ever- shrinking period between childhood and old age. It is the apparent aim of modern industrial societies to reduce this period to a minimum. I was born at the age of twelve on a Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer lot. We live in an age of instant knowledge. And there\\'s almost a sense of entitlement to that. It\\'s the golden age of French cinema again but it\\'s because Sarkozy had the guts to push through copyright law. I started in the restaurant business at the age of 19 as a waitress. I loved the atmosphere and the camaraderie of the restaurant business. I loved not having to go to an office. I loved making people happy. My view is pensioners don\\'t have the one option that people of working age have. They can\\'t really increase their income, because they are no longer able to work. \\x0cWork is transformative. It gives you a greater chance of a greater income. You can affect your life while you\\'re of working age, so you have scope and opportunity. Pensioners do not. I think you can\\'t really escape any kind of spiritual education as a child, whether it\\'s New Age or Judaism or Buddhism or whatever it is. You can\\'t escape it, even if you completely disagree with it, you still have it as a foundation that you base things off of. At my age the only problem is with remembering names. When I call everyone darling, it has damn all to do with passionately adoring them, but I know I\\'m safe calling them that. Although, of course, I adore them too. What I really tried to do with Helen was make her show this sad side of her. She was married off at 16, was so young and living in this castle that can\\'t leave because of how she looks, and married to a man she hates and three times her age. I never took guitar lessons. I took classical piano lessons from the age of six when we lived in Holland. And when we moved to America, it was just the typical thing except I was really good at it so was my brother. I never took guitar lessons. I took classical piano lessons from the age of six when we lived in Holland. When I write about a 15-year old, I jump, I return to the days when I was that age. It\\'s like a time machine. I can remember everything. I can feel the wind. I can smell the air. Very actually. Very vividly. We live in an age, in an era where there is so much negativity, there is so much violence in the world, there is so much unrest and people are at war, that I wanted to promote the word love and red signifies love. I\\'m 20 years old. I like to party as much as anyone my age. Going clubbing is my way of relaxing or releasing a lot of stress. I don\\'t feel that I should have to justify that part of my life. I don\\'t know that I\\'m necessarily an addict. I am happy being able to play roles with people my age because once you do something really mature there is no turning back. Compared to a lot of actresses my age, I\\'m actually overweight. \\x0cThis is what I asked for, and in this day and age that\\'s what actually goes on. But what hurts me the most is that I work just as hard as any other actress around my age, like Scarlett Johansson, but I just don\\'t get the opportunities that they get because people are so distracted by the mess that I created in my life. At a young age, I was interested in comic books, which was really how I learnt to read. The name Cage came from a comic book character called Power Man. There is a certain age at which a child looks at you in all earnestness and delivers a long, pleased speech in all the true inflections of spoken English, but with not one recognizable syllable. I can\\'t wait to be that age and hanging out with a bunch of people hanging out all day playing golf and going to the beach, all my own age. We\\'d be laughing and having a good time and getting loopy on our prescription drugs. Driving golf carts around. I can\\'t wait. I would love a family. I\\'m at the age where the wish for a child gets stronger. But who knows. I love physical kinds of comedy and getting down and dirty and doing stunts. When I was growing up, I was always getting into fights with guys and usually punching out boys my age because I was a lot bigger and tougher. So I\\'m naturally accustomed to putting myself into the headspace of a girl who can take care of herself. Love, with very young people, is a heartless business. We drink at that age from thirst, or to get drunk it is only later in life that we occupy ourselves with the individuality of our wine. Age for me is just a number. You hit a certain age and - especially because of TV - the young cooks coming up say, \\'You\\'re a sellout, because you\\'re doing something other than what you should be doing.\\' \\'Top Chef\\' is a double- edged sword for me: There\\'s a whole group of people who will not come to the restaurants because they assume I\\'m not in them anymore, all I do is TV. Some of your teachers are actually closer in age to you than you think. \\x0cFrom an early age I didn\\'t buy into the value systems of working hard in a nine-to-five job. I thought creativity, friendship and loyalty and pushing the boundaries of what was acceptable was much more interesting. I didn\\'t have any success in show business until I was 30 to 31 years of age. I hate the idea that you shouldn\\'t wear something just because you\\'re a certain age. I am firmly of the opinion that women who make a lot of effort to hang onto their looks in middle age (unless they are beauties, entertainers or prostitutes) are rather sad, as one should surely have something more substantial to recommend one by this time, such as kindness or cleverness. As a precocious teen I dreamed of being Graham Greene. Well, as it turned out, I never wrote a great novel, sadly, and I never converted to Catholicism, happily, but I did do one thing he did. That is, in middle age I moved to a seaside town and got into a right barney with the local powers-that-be. Age should not have its face lifted, but it should rather teach the world to admire wrinkles as the etchings of experience and the firm line of character. Age is only a number, a cipher for the records. A man can\\'t retire his experience. He must use it. Experience achieves more with less energy and time. To me, old age is always fifteen years older than I am. I wear clothes that most people in the Midwest would probably deem inappropriate at my age. And I rock a bikini all summer long. I know that it\\'s not normal, but I just don\\'t care. I live once. I\\'ve lost touch with a lot of that boutique-type music just because of my age, and raising my son and the multiple jobs I have at this point. There\\'s no way to approach anything in an objective way. We\\'re completely subjective our view of the world is completely controlled by who we are as human beings, as men or women, by our age, our history, our profession, by the state of the world. \\x0cAge is not measured by years. Nature does not equally distribute energy. Some people are born old and tired while others are going strong at seventy. Maybe it is something to do with age, but I have become fonder of poetry than of prose. When I was younger, my whole sense of self-worth was based on whether or not I was working, which was awful. And I had a baby at 20 years old, so it wasn\\'t just about me. At around the age of 30 there was a stretch where I wasn\\'t working - certainly not on anything I liked, anyway - and I started to do other things. I grew up on the golden age of children\\'s TV. I do wish I could tell you my age but it\\'s impossible. It keeps changing all the time. Pretend to be dumb, that\\'s the only way to reach old age. The excitement of learning separates youth from old age. As long as you\\'re learning you\\'re not old. The history of my life must begin by the earliest circumstance which my memory can evoke it will therefore commence when I had attained the age of eight years and four months. We are in an electronic technology age now and it\\'s about time we put away the old stuff. At the age of 20 I bought a used Fiat 127. This was the only one I could afford! At my age, I don\\'t think anyone is untouched by cancer. We try, we fail, we posture, we aspire, we pontificate - and then we age, shrink, die, and vanish. My habit would have been to veer towards the dark - to prove I was something edgy, or maybe to prove that I was cognisant of the dark side. Now, with age and confidence, I can say, yeah, that\\'s true, but I am cognisant of the fact that people can do things well. And can be more loving than you expect. It is not possible to live in this age if you don\\'t have a sense of many contradictory forces. I\\'m very accepting with my age. It\\'s like notches on your belt: experience, wisdom, and a different kind of beauty. There comes a day when you\\'ve become comfortable in your skin. \\x0cYou need some insecurity if you\\'re an actor. It keeps the pot boiling. I haven\\'t yet started to think about retiring. I was shocked when I heard about Paul Newman retiring at age 82. Most actors just fade away like old soldiers. It\\'s hard for women at my age in Hollywood, but I\\'m not discouraged. We\\'re still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch. That\\'s the old metaphor: You\\'re born, you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude. We can no longer waste time and money. Every day, more than 2,000 girls in America, age 15-19, give birth - in the wealthiest, most educated nation in the world! Neither you nor I should accept this statistic. The reality is sobering: in the United States one in three girls will become pregnant before age 20, totaling more than 750,000 girls per year. I am hoping for peaceful transition into a new age. Obama has already played a great role in initiating us into that vision. If he were to be harmed in any way, it would spawn the birth of a million Obamas. I definitely don\\'t look my age. So I actively look for roles that will help people change their perception of me. The age thing really bugs me. Do people have more of a right to not like what I say because I\\'m 19? There are a lot of downsides to being male. We age faster and die younger. But give us this: we\\'re lifetime baby- making machines. Women\\'s reproductive abilities start to wane when they\\'re as young as 35. Men? We\\'re good to go pretty much till we\\'re dead. Older fatherhood isn\\'t all bad: testosterone rates drop about 1% per year as men age, making them less reactive and more patient, and a professionally established middle-aged man is likely to have more time and money to devote to his kids than a twenty-something who\\'s just getting started. \\x0cCredit or debit cards, for starters, are nothing short of shoppers\\' Novocain. Even in the age of digital purchases and virtual money, we still attach a special value to dirty paper with pictures of presidents on it. Handing some of that to a cashier simply hurts more than handing over a little sliver of plastic. When it comes to raising civilized kids there are no hard rules, but there are two things on which most parents agree: Boys are generally wilder than girls, and adolescents are wilder than kids of any other age. If you\\'ve got an adolescent boy, you\\'re in the sweet spot for trouble. It seems to me there is a change in what audiences want to see. I can only hope that\\'s correct, because there\\'s an awful lot of people of my age around now and we outnumber the others. A truly great book should be read in youth, again in maturity and once more in old age, as a fine building should be seen by morning light, at noon and by moonlight. In Hollywood, you play a mom, and the next thing you know, you\\'re on \\'The Golden Girls.\\' They age you so fast. A great age of literature is perhaps always a great age of translations. I can\\'t get my knickers in a twist about my age and ageing in an industry that caters to the ids of 14-year- olds. I was living on the wrong side of the tracks in Evanston, Illinois, in a home for boys. We had these Jackson 5 records. I really related to their voices - they were about my age, but they were doing it. By age seven, I used to comb my hair for performances, just pull my hair up into a bun. Granted, it wasn\\'t a very intricate hairstyle. Still, to be that responsible and disciplined at age seven is unusual. It begins and ends with money. It\\'s absurd in this day and age when we need so much money for education, health, for people, that a $100 million dollars can be spent on a film. It\\'s obscene. I am at that age when you panic at the slightest thing. Being gay and being a woman has one big thing in common, which is that we both become invisible after the age of 42. Who wants a gay 50-year-old? No one, let me tell you. \\x0cI began to speak well at a very advanced age - 15, 16, 17 years old. It was psychological: the trauma of war, my family and growing up on my own. I was more or less a street kid. We Jews have a special attachment to the Book. The study of page after page in tomes yellowing with age was obligatory. Having come to live in this age is as though one were to have entered another country. Learn its language or risk being left out. I don\\'t want to look at other people my age in leather. Why would I put it on? I believe that the fight against crime starts in the home. Parents must take responsibility for their children and show them love and guidance from an early age so they learn to respect the rights of others. At an early age, I started my own paper route. Once I saw how you could service people and do a good job and get paid for it, I just wanted to be the best I could be in whatever I did. Middle age: when you begin to exchange your emotions for symptoms. Brain power improves by brain use, just as our bodily strength grows with exercise. And there is no doubt that a large proportion of the female population, from school days to late middle age, now have very complicated lives indeed. I began to understand my sensations, to know what I wanted, at around the age of forty - but only vaguely. I grew up on a farm in a small town where you do or say one thing and everybody knows about it. You see it happen, there\\'s always the town gossip - \\'Oh did you hear about so and so, or did you hear what went on in this household?\\' So I learned at a very young age just to keep my mouth shut. If you love somebody, you love them. My parents had a 25-year age gap between them and my mum was the breadwinner, my dad the house husband. I\\'m a strong believer that a good relationship can work, whatever the situation.  The Border Ballads, for instance, and the Robin Hood Ballads, clearly suppose a state of society which is nothing but a very circumscribed and not very important heroic age. \\x0cBy the age of 9 or 10, I knew that I had to cut my own cloth and make my own way. When you\\'re my age and you see a story, you better go for it pretty quickly. I\\'d just like to get a few more novels under my belt. Catholics and evangelicals need to remain allied, and in solidarity, against the increasingly aggressive secularism of our age. I don\\'t know whether it\\'s age or maturity, but I certainly find myself committed more and more to the looser forms of Western democracy at any price. Losing both parents at a young age gave me a sense that you can\\'t really control life - so you\\'d better live it while it\\'s here. I stopped believing in a storybook existence a long time ago. All you can do is push in a direction and see what comes of it. Old age is not a disease - it is strength and survivorship, triumph over all kinds of vicissitudes and disappointments, trials and illnesses. I was a very sickly kid. While I was in the hospital at age 7, my Dad brought me a stack of comic books to keep me occupied. I was hooked. Study until twenty-five, investigation until forty, profession until sixty, at which age I would have him retired on a double allowance. In the digital age of \\'overnight\\' success stories such as Facebook, the hard slog is easily overlooked. The greatest writers of this age... are aware of the mystery of our existence. The chief role of the universities is to prolong adolescence into middle age, at which point early retirement ensures that we lack the means or the will to enforce significant change. My grandparents got married at a very young age, and a lot of what I think about marriage is based on their relationship. I watched them over the years and saw how they dealt with everything together, as a team. My grandparents got married at a very young age, and a lot of what I think about marriage is based on their relationship. At my age it is unseemly to be pessimistic. \\x0cI don\\'t know why people are so obsessed with age anyway. I mean, 90 is the new 70 70 is the new 50 and 50 is the new 40 so the whole act- your-age thing? Only up to a point. I don\\'t look my age, I don\\'t feel my age and I don\\'t act my age. To me age is just a number. I believe that parents need to make nutrition education a priority in their home environment. It\\'s crucial for good health and longevity to instill in your children sound eating habits from an early age. Most poetry in the modern age has retreated to the private sphere, turning its back on the political realm. We incorporated new tastes and flavors into our kids\\' diets from a very early age, which helped to develop their palates and prevented them from becoming picky eaters. We don\\'t buy junk food and give them options of fresh fruit, yogurt, raw almonds, or dried whole grain cereals for snack time. Filth and old age, I\\'m sure you will agree, are powerful wardens upon chastity. It has been claimed at times that our modern age of technology facilitates dictatorship. Working on the \\'Ice Age\\' movies, I\\'m really proud to be in them. No Congress ever has seen fit to amend the Constitution to address any issue related to marriage. No Constitutional Amendment was needed to ban polygamy or bigamy, nor was a Constitutional Amendment needed to set a uniform age of majority to ban child marriages. We\\'re taught at such a young age that you can always be better and that you\\'re never perfect and that you\\'re never good enough. The young people have MTV and rock and roll. Why would they go to read poetry? Poetry belongs to the Stone Age. It awakens in us perceptions that go back to those times. Study is the bane of childhood, the oil of youth, the indulgence of adulthood, and a restorative in old age. Because of my age and because there\\'s more work on the small screen. What it\\'s missing in quality it makes up for in quantity. From an actor\\'s selfish point of view. Old age is an insult. It\\'s like being smacked. \\x0cAge puzzles me. I thought it was a quiet time. My seventies were interesting and fairly serene, but my eighties are passionate. I grow more intense as I age. One of the great challenges of our age, in which the tools of our productivity are also the tools of our leisure, is to figure out how to make more useful those moments of procrastination when we\\'re idling in front of our computer screens. I happen to be interested in watching a face age. I like faces of women aging so it makes me personally quite sad. That\\'s a beautiful gift from God. If people don\\'t want to see that anymore then I won\\'t be in anymore movies. Never say never, but the thought of electively cutting oneself is beyond my grasp, and I also object to it politically. Denying the lines on our faces makes a comment about age and wisdom I don\\'t care to make. People pay to see movies with women looking beautiful, but I think there will be a place for me to play women looking my own age. There\\'s a small club of women who are willing to age. I hope to find the roles that are age appropriate but not yearning to be younger, or parenting ad nauseam. I try to write lyrics so that they won\\'t age, which sort of leaves you with the big subjects like death and love and sex and violence. In the modern media age we are rarely surprised by what we see. Whether it\\'s on television or film or in the theatre, everything is so advertised, so trailed, that most entertainment is merely what you thought it was going to be like. Your 40s are a major trough. About the age of 50, feelings of satisfaction begin to rebound and keep rising into your 50s, 60s and 70s, with health being a major factor. I came back to work when my children were two months old. At that early age, they seem to have little awareness of anybody but their Raggedy Ann dolls, so it wasn\\'t a matter of them missing me. I was missing them. Being successful at a very young age gave me the confidence and the capability to try out other things. \\x0cAbout the time I turned 50, I experienced the profound biological change that often accompanies women at that age. Also, I put two kids in college and lost both of my parents, so I\\'m no longer somebody\\'s daughter. I feel more mature than most people my age. Age does not bring you wisdom, age brings you wrinkles. Maybe I\\'ll be a feminist in my old age. I feel the 21st century is another new age. Not only can we collaborate again with nature, but we have to. It\\'s an emergency. You can fake your age or mask it, but the passion that moves the characters has to be real. I think that clearly it has an influence, to be coming of age during the punk rock era, to come from a difficult and sporadically violent background, to have been in and out of such chaos, I think it actually helps. But I don\\'t know for sure. I\\'d date someone younger or older age doesn\\'t matter to me. Or looks, really - it\\'s all about maturity. Try to keep your soul young and quivering right up to old age. I wanted to be a forest ranger or a coal man. At a very early age, I knew I didn\\'t want to do what my dad did, which was work in an office. Parenting is an impossible job at any age. Sally Field looks amazing in general, never mind her age! She\\'s a phenomenally talented actress and has had a career spanning so many decades. I\\'ve had two romances since moving to Las Vegas. One was with somebody 12 years older than me, and the other was the same age, and neither worked out. I know people still think of me as one of Hugh Hefner\\'s girlfriends, and he of course was much older than me, but that was a whole different lifestyle and a different kind of dating. From age 16, I lived and breathed wine. I read every magazine and book about wine. \\x0cIQ is a commodity, data is a commodity. I\\'m far more interested in watching people interact at a restaurant with their smartphone. We can all read \\'Tech Crunch,\\' \\'Ad Age.\\' I would rather be living in the trenches. I would rather be going to Whole Foods in Columbus Circle to watch people shop with their smartphones. Genius worship is the inevitable sign of an uncreative age. I appreciate and enjoy my age. I\\'ve been going through photos of my mother, looking back on her life and trying to put it into context. Very few people age gracefully enough to be photographed through their aging. I am rediscovering the whole sexual dimension of life at the age of 86, really. And that also means discovering the feminine. So the whole of this dimension, which I had been seeking for a very long time, is now sort of opening itself up to me. I think all writers of my age who are brought up on films probably by the age of 16 have seen many more films than they have read classics of literature. We can\\'t help but be influenced by film. Film has got some great tricks that it\\'s taught writers. Some broad themes brought me where I am today. At a very young age, my hobby became thinking and finding connections. I think you have to be a little bit strict. You can\\'t be friend and their parent in a lot of situations, especially in this day and age where it\\'s so dangerous for kids. So there\\'s a bit of sternness, I guess, in the way I raise my kids. In the 1970s and 1980s there was so little decent fiction for young people, but we\\'re now in a golden age that shows no sign of fading. Philip Pullman, J. K. Rowling, Lemony Snicket are only three of the best known among a good number of equals. I want to sell to people my own age, because that\\'s the way I write songs. You get to a certain age and you just want to prove that you can still rock - that you\\'ve still got it. I always thought that I might retire from any form of sexuality by the age of 40 and just become a dignified older person. \\x0cIt\\'s only at this age that I can say the word \\'art\\' without flinching. Well, once you\\'ve resigned yourself to the fact that you are the more mature pop performer and you\\'re past the age you ever thought you would do it, you might as well do it as long as you can. As long as I can still lift a microphone, then I\\'ll do it, you know. I hope to have one more boxing match at the age of 55. Given that demographic at the age of 55 to 65, you\\'ve got to make a statement with your life. Otherwise, you are just existing. I think it\\'s hard, the fact that there\\'s a certain age that we can\\'t have kids anymore. While I had often said that I wanted to die in bed, what I really meant was that in my old age I wanted to be stepped on by an elephant while making love. I basically started playing violin at the age of six. That lasted about three years because my previous teacher died and the second teacher didn\\'t really know how to successfully get me going. Age acquires no value save through thought and discipline. I\\'ve had to be a man since I was 12 or 13. I had a job. And I was playing the piano for people twice my age. Handling responsibility is what makes a man a man. Old age isn\\'t so bad when you consider the alternative. Up until age 40, most men are just not as mature as women. So, it makes sense that a lot of women date up in age a bit. Think back to yourself at age 18. I know I was mighty different than the Patti I am today. As we grow up, we grow out of our haircuts, our apartments and - often times - our romantic decisions. I was well motivated. What I wanted to do was work for myself. I had twenty two jobs before I started my business at the age of twenty three and I didn\\'t want one more boss telling me what to do. So I was motivated simply because I didn\\'t want a boss. \\x0cRegardless of age, regardless of position, regardless of the business we happen to be in, all of us need to understand the importance of branding. We are CEOs of our own companies: Me, Inc. To be in business today, our most important job is to be head marketer for the brand called You. An age which is incapable of poetry is incapable of any kind of literature except the cleverness of a decadence. I\\'ve always felt that sexuality is a really slippery thing. In this day and age, it tends to get categorized and labeled, and I think labels are for food. Canned food. There must be a law against forcing children to perform at an early age. Children should have a wonderful childhood. They should not be given too much responsibility. Each age tries to form its own conception of the past. Each age writes the history of the past anew with reference to the conditions uppermost in its own time. People quit on jobs. They quit on marriages. They quit on school. There\\'s an immediacy of this day and age that doesn\\'t lend itself to being committed to anything. I nearly died of double bronchial pneumonia at the age of five. The wonderful thing about age is that your knees don\\'t work as well, you can\\'t run down steps quite as easily and obviously you can\\'t lift heavy weights. But your mind doesn\\'t feel any different. In a secular age, an authentic miracle must purport to be a hoax, in order to gain credit in the world. But I think it\\'s a little different in Europe, because 40 is really the best age for a woman. That\\'s when we hit our peak and become this ripe fruit. My mother was 45 when she had me, so when I was in high school my parents were the same age as my friends\\' grandparents. In the age of television, image becomes more important than substance. Just call me a family man and an actor who digs his whole scene, side interests and all. Just say I feel mighty good at the ripe old age of 27. \\x0cMaybe back in the day you didn\\'t need to be the greatest looking to be on TV and you didn\\'t need to speak the best, but in this day and age, I think you need to be the package. You need to look the part for your sponsors, you need to be able to speak the part for the media and to big CEOs. The culture of independent film criticism has totally gone down the drain and this seems to come with the territory of the consumer age that we are now living in. There are only three things that can kill a farmer: lightning, rolling over in a tractor, and old age. They say eyes clear with age. Growing up on stage, I was introduced to makeup at a young age and I will never forget the first time I tried on a L\\'Oreal Paris iconic lipstick - it was instant glamour and I\\'ve been hooked ever since. I don\\'t mind my age. Despite what anti-aging ads say, growing older can be better. I feel better in my skin, 100 percent. You have greater effects of gravity, but the better sense of yourself you have is something I wouldn\\'t trade. Women who lie about their age - \\'why?\\' For the moment I prefer to be a beautiful woman of my age than try desperately to look 30. It\\'s a little silly to finally learn how to write at this age. But I long ago realized I was secretly sincere. It\\'s not always possible to sit down and eat at home in this day and age of fast-paced living, but if you are going to eat out, do so as a family and support all the great local places in your areas. I\\'ll still eat at the same diner I did as a kid with my parents. I worked hard in gymnastics since the time I was six years old until I retired at 23 years of age. I did successfully kick tobacco at the age of 34. I smoked for like 20 years, from 14 to 34. India saw from the beginning, and, even in her ages of reason and her age of increasing ignorance, she never lost hold of the insight, that life cannot be rightly seen in the sole light, cannot be perfectly lived in the sole power of its externalities. Back in the 1960s, I saw Peter, Paul and Mary. I was at that age, about 14, and I was mesmerized. \\x0cFor me from a pretty young age up until about 21 years old hallucinogenics had a huge place in my life. A sense of freedom is something that, happily, comes with age and life experience. Writers obviously have to bear witness to the harsh face of the age. Stop living a day at a time and stop worrying about age. Young women from a very young age are taught that life will be easier if you can just turn on the charming smile and say very little and be complacent and docile and sweet. I started writing when I had three kids under the age of 4. I used to write every ten minutes I got to sit in front of a computer. Now, when I have more time, I function the same way: if it\\'s writing time, I write. I\\'m never overawed by a situation and I think that\\'s because I\\'ve always looked several years older than I am. So because people were treating me like I was 40 when I was 29, I\\'ve always felt in control of a situation. People used to say, when you\\'re 32, you\\'ll look 32. I\\'m still waiting for that moment, where my age catches up with my appearance. I am 54 and age is slowly writing itself on my face. I envy the sensibility in Europe, appreciating beauty in women as they age. I\\'m going to go that way. I might dye my gray hair for a bit, but beyond that the buck stops. I\\'m not having any work done. It was Julie Burchill who decreed that, beyond a certain age, a man should not be seen in a leather jacket. As a result of the digital age and the decline of first-class mail, there is no question that the Postal Service must change and develop a new business model. I\\'ve watched my peers get better with age and hoped that would happen with me. I never wanted to do TV. I just did what I was trained to do through the Special Forces, and I\\'ve been doing that from a very young age. Here\\'s a proposal, offered only partly in jest: no resident of the United States, whether born here or abroad, should get to be a citizen until age 18, at which time each such resident has to take a test. Second to agriculture, humbug is the biggest industry of our age. \\x0cWhen it comes down to it, it\\'s about who you know, and who\\'s a fan. It\\'s about whether you\\'re the right age, whether you\\'re hot or not, whether the studio is into you or not. Another principle is, the deepest affections of our hearts gather around some human form in which are incarnated the living thoughts and ideas of the passing age. My acting career began at age three and my parents got me into it. I was in a McDonald\\'s commercial. I think that age as a number is not nearly as important as health. You can be in poor health and be pretty miserable at 40 or 50. If you\\'re in good health, you can enjoy things into your 80s. I just yesterday returned from a trip where I photographed a woman with two children whom I photographed first when she was the age of the older of the two children. You live in a deranged age, more deranged that usual, because in spite of great scientific and technological advances, man has not the faintest idea of who he is or what he is doing. To write a story about New York that only deals with people in your age and socioeconomic bracket, that feels dishonest to me. So much of New York comes from everyone bumping into each other. My mother inspired me to treat others as I would want to be treated regardless of age, race or financial status. And from the first time I picked up a basketball at age eight - I had a lot of difficulty when I first picked up a basketball, because I was a scrub - there were things that I liked about it. Right up until the time I retired at age 37, I felt like there were still things that I could do better. In 1981, at age 31, I was voted the best player in basketball, and the most valuable player in the league. The great thing about arriving at this age is that I don\\'t even care about my career anymore. \\x0cAlmost all of your life is lived by the seat of your pants, one unexpected event crashing into another, with no pattern or reason, and then you finally reach a point, around my age, where you spend more time than ever looking back. Why did this happen? Look where that led? You see the shape of things. I\\'ve always been intrigued by color and by interesting hair. I was one of those weird little girls doing my own hair at the age of 9. I was, like, getting weird gels and new brushes and cornrow holders. I would tweak and perm at the age of 13. There are no college courses to build up self-esteem or high school or elementary school. If you don\\'t get those values at a early age, nurtured in your home, you don\\'t get them. The freethinking of one age is the common sense of the next. If children are not introduced to music at an early age, I believe something fundamental is actually being taken from them. Middle age is when your broad mind and narrow waist begin to change places. As an American, you have a right to good health care that is effective, accessible, and affordable, that serves you from infancy through old age, that allows you to go to practitioners and facilities of your choosing, and that offers a broad range of therapeutic options. Women would be disproportionately affected by the privatization of social security. It is one of the most important safety nets for American women in old age, or in times of disability, to insure financial income for their families. Low levels of vitamin D in the population as a whole suggest that most people need to take a vitamin D supplement. This may be especially true for seniors, as the ability to synthesize vitamin D in the skin declines with age. Part of the reason I sort of shot out like a cannon out of Michigan and left home at such an early age is because I had to feel independent. \\x0cI think that everyone at any age should ask themselves, \\'where do I want to be today, where do I want to be tomorrow, and where do I want to be in a hundred years?\\' We all have clear answers to those questions. We only have so much time. It\\'s a real shame if we don\\'t spend our lives trying to do that. My parents got married late and they had kids late, so I never felt a social or cultural thing to be married or pregnant or a homeowner by a certain age. I\\'m a pretty big dork. It\\'s crazy. I\\'m one of those people who grew up with all kinds of musicals, but I was right at that age where \\'Rent\\' was a big deal for me and for my friends. My parents were really, really cool about supporting what I wanted to do at a really young age. I think I was about 10 when I caught the bug. They would drive me down to New York if there were auditions. When I was 12, I did this show on Broadway called \\'High Society,\\' so we moved to New York for the run of that. I was very sexual from a very young age. It is a sobering thought that when Mozart was my age, he had been dead for two years. And I\\'m not as young as I once was. At my age, I don\\'t have time to be bored. I was drafted into the Army when I was 19 and came out at age 22. Most people that I knew didn\\'t think they\\'d come home alive. I didn\\'t think I would either, so I was happy when I did. One already feels like an anachronism, writing novels in the age of what-ever-this-is- the-age-of, but touring to promote them feels doubly anachronistic. The marketplace is showing an increasing intolerance for the time-honored practice of printing information on paper and shipping it around the country. To own the dominant, or only, newspaper in a mid-sized American city was, for many decades, a kind of license to print money. In the Internet age, however, no one has figured out how to rescue the newspaper in the United States or abroad. I grew up loving horses. I was relatively obsessed, starting with my rocking horse at age 2, all the way through my painting and drawing phase. \\x0cI was equally in love with singing and acting from an early age. You can construct the character of a man and his age not only from what he does and says, but from what he fails to say and do. I never played much golf as a kid. I caddied quite a bit but never got serious into golf until about age 15. These days too many of us seem inclined to cover our ears, close our eyes, and blindly follow the most narrow, conservative tenets of religion or else seek comfort in the ancient traditions of New Age ritual. There is no age, height, or weight requirement to skate. It is good exercise no matter what your age is. If you want to be competitive, most start young. But, I practice with many adult competitors. I remember when I was 6 years old and my brother used to go seek out guys that were 13 to come over and play football against me while he was the \\'permanent quarterback.\\' I didn\\'t know exactly what the age difference was, but I was already playing against older guys. Well, my son really loves wildlife. And everytime he draws a polar bear I want to tell him there probably won\\'t any by the time... he\\'s my age. That\\'s kinda hard to deal with. To be perfectly honest, I think that as I\\'m growing older, I\\'m just growing more impatient. I\\'ll be very happy if at some point people say, \\'Michael\\'s grown wiser and softer in his old age.\\' But we\\'ll have to wait and see what my next project is. A woman my age is not supposed to be attractive or sexually appealing. I just get kinda tired of that. Listen, in England people are already writing their memoirs at the age of 23. I was apprehensive. I feared every time I talked about poetry, it would be filtered through the lens of race, sex, and age. Everyone takes pause at 40. It\\'s the age you have to assess everything in your life. It\\'s the fictitious marker that\\'s always coming up when you\\'re young. The world really does look at you to kind of have it together by 40, and be successful by 40. Whatever success means. \\x0cI started out modeling at a young age and surrounded myself with different brilliant minds. I have so many people to get educated from, and I\\'ve been a sponge. People say women shouldn\\'t have long hair over a certain age, but I\\'ve never done what everyone says. We tend to think of age only in time, but I don\\'t think it has much to do with time at all there\\'s a whole load of other things. I\\'ve met 16-year-olds who are old and 90-year-olds who are young. It looks good when you see someone kicking at the age of 51 with no double. It\\'s kinda cool for people to know that past 50 we can keep flexible. The second album was emotionally exhausting and my life felt like it had become very serious at a very young age. I never felt totally, 100%, patriotically English... I\\'d seen a lot of the world by an early age - sort of spent a lot of time traveling around Lebanon and I\\'d seen Babylon, and Damascus, and all sorts of places in the Middle East by the time I was ten. Then we\\'d return to Ruslip in West London... Done a fair bit of traveling really. The first feminine feature that goes, with advancing age, is the neck. You just never know when you\\'re living in a golden age. We now have an opportunity, though, to do something we didn\\'t do in the industrial age, and that is to get a leg up on this, to bring the public in quickly, to have an informed debate. I\\'ve spent as much as 30 grand on a watch but it\\'s not about flaunting my wealth. I don\\'t have many extravagances but watches are my biggest one. I must have 30 of them now. I\\'ve been collecting since the age of nine, when I won a black TAG in a karting event. We were making the first step out of the age of chemistry and physics, and into the age of biology. I feel like women are asked their age more than men. Even in this day and age, if you\\'re not married, there are people who are like, \\'Awww! Don\\'t worry, it\\'ll happen for you someday.\\' \\x0cFor students today, only 10 percent of children from working-class families graduate from college by the age of 24 as compared to 58 percent of upper-middle-class and wealthy families. I have worked very hard on being aware of my childhood but moving forward and not letting it bring me down emotionally. That is a hard thing - especially when you have children of your own and you remember what happened to you at that age. Traveling to Russia and Germany and being able to see the world at a young age was really cool for me, and I really liked that. I vividly remember being 14. That was the age when I started to get happy: I started being a writer and stopped being a loser. The balance of private good and general welfare is at the bottom of civilized morals but the morals of the Heroic Age are founded on individuality, and on nothing else. I also find it interesting that a lot of people in their 30s are not married and don\\'t have kids. There are a lot of people in this age bracket that are out there dating and trying to find love. And I never thought that at my age I would be. The reason can only be this: heroic poetry depends on an heroic age, and an age is heroic because of what it is, not because of what it does. The 19th century was the age of Individualism the 20th and 21st are the ages of Socialism. We live in an age of mediocrity. I gambled and I lost. I failed in securing my options for this choice for myself, but I succeeded in verifying the Dark Age is still with us. I always looked really young for my age. And once I hit 23, 24 and 25, I was then allowed to play the cool 18-year-olds and stuff. I want to be age appropriate. I don\\'t want to be that girl you see walking away and she looks 25 and then she turns around and she looks 90.  When I was at school, I was in choirs more than anything else, from a very young age, about 9 years old. And then I started taking drum lessons. \\x0cI was always obsessed with being famous. I had Marilyn Monroe paper dolls as a child, and I was always obsessed with her. I\\'ve just been really driven in that direction, and none of my friends were. So, I don\\'t know what put that bug in me at a young age. All my early school reports from the age of 5 were \\'Daniel must learn not to distract others.\\' At the age of 11 I was about 6 ft. tall and my voice had completely broken. That caused problems. I was this gangly, spotty, very unattractive kid. I wasn\\'t cool and I wasn\\'t a nerd. I didn\\'t even want to fit in with anyone. I\\'ve always tried to do my very best, and I want to be the very best age, whatever age I am. I never quite toed the line. I was a bit disruptive. All my early school reports from the age of 5 were \\'Daniel must learn not to distract others.\\' And now, that\\'s what I do for a living. One problem with age is that patience begins to ebb. Men of my age live in a state of continual desperation. Starting a new retirement plan for those below a certain age is something tens of millions of Americans have already been through at work. Anybody under the age of forty knows hip-hop, gospel and R&ampB pretty well, and it\\'s all a part of what we consider to be \\'black music.\\' There is a natural synergy between the three. Well, Jeff Buckley for me is one of the greatest singers I\\'ve ever heard. And the reason why is he has an amazing range, amazing emotional power in his voice. And the music he put around it also just had this passion and this soul to it and this spirit to it that very few artists have, and he passed at a very young age. It\\'s getting better generally, daily, especially in TV, for women in acting and age and looks count less. As more women come into the business. Change of any sort takes a long time to happen. I think the most exciting thing is that you expect people our age to know the music, but actually a lot of kids know the music, and if anything is left, we have left really good music, and that\\'s the important part, not the mop- tops or whatever. \\x0cIt doesn\\'t matter what color, sex, religion, age, sexual orientation, etc., everyone should have the same freedoms and liberties. Childhood itself is scarcely more lovely than a cheerful, kindly, sunshiny old age. In my older age, I\\'ve learned to take things slower, because I used to be that total-fall-in- love-after-a-day guy. You watch yourself age and it\\'s hard to feel like a sex symbol. I like to be alone so I can write. But focus can hurt you. I don\\'t want to be some stress casualty in early middle age. I\\'d always thought the Rats were good fun, but one of the very nice things about being of Saga age is that I can actually look back and think, When I was younger I was in a great band. It was always a collective thing. I do think I feel it but you don\\'t think you are cause at a certain time you are no age but you don\\'t think you are anything. You feel the life you have lived. I feel that. It\\'s been a long fifty years. The crucial task of old age is balance: keeping just well enough, just brave enough, just gay and interested and starkly honest enough to remain a sentient human being. My first job was in retail at the age of 14, and I have worked in the industry ever since. I believed my story would be helpful to young women my daughter\\'s age, who are still in the process of forming themselves as women, and in need of encouragement to remain true to themselves. Old age and sickness bring out the essential characteristics of a man. We hold that the most wonderful and splendid proof of genius is a great poem produced in a civilized age. The age we live in is a busy age in which knowledge is rapidly advancing towards perfection. In a spiritually sensitive culture, then, it might well be that age is something to be admired or envied. What though youth gave love and roses, Age still leaves us friends and wine. If there is anything I would do differently in my life, it is that I would study business more. I\\'m trying to teach my daughter Chloe at an early age about investing and money so she\\'s not afraid of it. \\x0cAny young man who is unmarried at the age of twenty one is a menace to the community. Time, in general, has always been a central obsession of mine - what it does to people, how it can constitute a plot all on its own. So naturally, I am interested in old age. The first crocodile I ever caught was at nine years of age, and it was a rescue. It is strange to be known so universally and yet to be so lonely. Alone we can do so little together we can do so much. It\\'s often just enough to be with someone. I don\\'t need to touch them. Not even talk. A feeling passes between you both. You\\'re not alone. Associate with men of good quality if you esteem your own reputation for it is better to be alone than in bad company. I restore myself when I\\'m alone. A man is born alone and dies alone and he experiences the good and bad consequences of his karma alone and he goes alone to hell or the Supreme abode. I have to be alone very often. I\\'d be quite happy if I spent from Saturday night until Monday morning alone in my apartment. That\\'s how I refuel. I don\\'t want to be alone, I want to be left alone. You cannot be lonely if you like the person you\\'re alone with. We allow our ignorance to prevail upon us and make us think we can survive alone, alone in patches, alone in groups, alone in races, even alone in genders. If it\\'s true that our species is alone in the universe, then I\\'d have to say the universe aimed rather low and settled for very little. Language... has created the word \\'loneliness\\' to express the pain of being alone. And it has created the word \\'solitude\\' to express the glory of being alone. I love to be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude. Look at the sky. We are not alone. The whole universe is friendly to us and conspires only to give the best to those who dream and work. Every man must do two things alone he must do his own believing and his own dying. \\x0cLoneliness is my least favorite thing about life. The thing that I\\'m most worried about is just being alone without anybody to care for or someone who will care for me.  I have never found a companion that was so companionable as solitude. We are for the most part more lonely when we go abroad among men than when we stay in our chambers. A man thinking or working is always alone, let him be where he will. I finally faced the fact that it isn\\'t a crime not having friends. Being alone means you have fewer problems. Yes, I guess you could say I am a loner, but I feel more lonely in a crowed room with boring people than I feel on my own. The only real progress lies in learning to be wrong all alone. If you are lonely when you\\'re alone, you are in bad company. Life could be wonderful if people would leave you alone. All men\\'s miseries derive from not being able to sit in a quiet room alone. We are rarely proud when we are alone. We are all sentenced to solitary confinement inside our own skins, for life. It\\'s an interesting combination: Having a great fear of being alone, and having a desperate need for solitude and the solitary experience. That\\'s always been a tug of war for me. Unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean, man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives. Man\\'s life is independent. He is born not for the development of the society alone, but for the development of his self. If I am a legend, then why am I so lonely? A man can be himself only so long as he is alone. What a lovely surprise to finally discover how unlonely being alone can be. Still and all, why bother? Here\\'s my answer. Many people need desperately to receive this message: I feel and think much as you do, care about many of the things you care about, although most people do not care about them. You are not alone. When so many are lonely as seem to be lonely, it would be inexcusably selfish to be lonely alone. \\x0cYou come into the world alone and you go out of the world alone yet it seems to me you are more alone while living than even going and coming. To live alone is the fate of all great souls. The time you feel lonely is the time you most need to be by yourself. I\\'ve also seen that great men are often lonely. This is understandable, because they have built such high standards for themselves that they often feel alone. But that same loneliness is part of their ability to create. In Genesis, it says that it is not good for a man to be alone but sometimes it is a great relief. I only go out to get me a fresh appetite for being alone. The lonely become either thoughtful or empty. There\\'s a tremendous difference between alone and lonely. You could be lonely in a group of people. I like being alone. I like eating by myself. I go home at night and just watch a movie or hang out with my dog. I have to exert myself and really say, oh God, I\\'ve got to see my friends \\'cause I\\'m too content being by myself. I really enjoy being single again. I spent a lot of time in a relationship and the nearer we came to the end, the more difficult it got. You don\\'t see things clearly as long as you\\'re still involved. The best part about being alone is that you really don\\'t have to answer to anybody. You do what you want. The desire to get married, which - I regret to say, I believe is basic and primal in women - is followed almost immediately by an equally basic and primal urge - which is to be single again. Who knows what true loneliness is - not the conventional word but the naked terror? To the lonely themselves it wears a mask. The most miserable outcast hugs some memory or some illusion. Living alone makes it harder to find someone to blame. As a body everyone is single, as a soul never. The capacity for not feeling lonely can carry a very real price, that of feeling nothing at all. Always give a word or sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, or even a stranger, if in a lonely place. \\x0cAll men\\'s misfortunes spring from their hatred of being alone. To dare to live alone is the rarest courage since there are many who had rather meet their bitterest enemy in the field, than their own hearts in their closet. Even in the presence of others he was completely alone. Alone let him constantly meditate in solitude on that which is salutary for his soul, for he who meditates in solitude attains supreme bliss. I have so many different personalities in me and I still feel lonely. I never said, \\'I want to be alone.\\' I only said, \\'I want to be left alone.\\' There is all the difference. Every man is born as many men and dies as a single one. I paint self-portraits because I am so often alone, because I am the person I know best. As I get older I\\'m more and more comfortable being alone. I\\'m fascinated with myself and love hearing the sound of my own voice. I\\'d like to hear what I have to say. A lot of people don\\'t like being alone because they truly don\\'t like themselves, but I love me. I would be married, but I\\'d have no wife, I would be married to a single life. Unless we love and are loved, each of us is alone, each of us is deeply lonely. A man content to go to heaven alone will never go to heaven. He that can live alone resembles the brute beast in nothing, the sage in much, and God in everything. Remember we\\'re all in this alone. Solitude is the profoundest fact of the human condition. Man is the only being who knows he is alone. Absolutely lonely people have few personal interactions of any kind. Is he alone who has courage on his right hand and faith on his left hand? Don\\'t go away. I don\\'t want to be alone. I can\\'t stand being alone. Inside myself is a place where I live all alone and that is where I renew my springs that never dry up. Being alone is very difficult. I would rather be a beggar and single than a queen and married. If you make friends with yourself you will never be alone. \\x0cOnly the lonely know the way I feel tonight. Be able to be alone. Lose not the advantage of solitude, and the society of thyself. The longer one is alone, the easier it is to hear the song of the earth. All of our unhappiness comes from our inability to be alone. When the people you love are gone, you\\'re alone. You can\\'t fake it when you\\'re alone with God, you know. Nothing makes us so lonely as our secrets. If you\\'re going to put yourself above everybody else, you might end up alone. By all means use some time to be alone. I think I jump around more when I\\'m alone. When I\\'m alone, I can sleep crossways in bed without an argument. There are places and moments in which one is so completely alone that one sees the world entire. I\\'m happily single. You\\'re only lonely if you\\'re not there for you. I\\'m single, footloose and fancy free, I have no responsibilities, no anchors. Work, friendship and self- improvement, that\\'s me. When everything is lonely I can be my best friend. A human being is a single being. Unique and unrepeatable. Your actions, and your action alone, determines your worth. I think the greatest amount of pressure is the pressure I place on myself. So in a way I chose to be alone. You only grow when you are alone. We\\'re born alone, we live alone, we die alone. Only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that we\\'re not alone. For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success. Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light. \\x0cBefore the throne of the Almighty, man will be judged not by his acts but by his intentions. For God alone reads our hearts. It\\'s better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone - so far. Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another. Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not the world is full of educated failures. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. I may climb perhaps to no great heights, but I will climb alone. What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do. I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do. We can be tired, weary and emotionally distraught, but after spending time alone with God, we find that He injects into our bodies energy, power and strength. Every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people alone. The people themselves are its only safe depositories. It is error alone which needs the support of government. Truth can stand by itself. The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God. Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be. The hours I spend with you I look upon as sort of a perfumed garden, a dim twilight, and a fountain singing to it. You and you alone make me feel that I am alive. Other men it is said have seen angels, but I have seen thee and thou art enough. Our Lord has written the promise of resurrection, not in books alone, but in every leaf in springtime. \\x0cI think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered at the White House - with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone. One travels more usefully when alone, because he reflects more. Always vote for principle, though you may vote alone, and you may cherish the sweetest reflection that your vote is never lost. Each player must accept the cards life deals him or her: but once they are in hand, he or she alone must decide how to play the cards in order to win the game. Justice cannot be for one side alone, but must be for both. It is better to be alone than in bad company. Perhaps I know best why it is man alone who laughs he alone suffers so deeply that he had to invent laughter. The soul that sees beauty may sometimes walk alone. A man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to let alone. To Follow by faith alone is to follow blindly. You are capable of more than you know. Choose a goal that seems right for you and strive to be the best, however hard the path. Aim high. Behave honorably. Prepare to be alone at times, and to endure failure. Persist! The world needs all you can give. You can get help from teachers, but you are going to have to learn a lot by yourself, sitting alone in a room. Unconditional war can no longer lead to unconditional victory. It can no longer serve to settle disputes... can no longer be of concern to great powers alone. Associate yourself with people of good quality, for it is better to be alone than in bad company. Virtue is not left to stand alone. He who practices it will have neighbors. An artist is always alone - if he is an artist. No, what the artist needs is loneliness. The man who goes alone can start today but he who travels with another must wait till that other is ready. \\x0cBeing solitary is being alone well: being alone luxuriously immersed in doings of your own choice, aware of the fullness of your won presence rather than of the absence of others. Because solitude is an achievement. I have noticed... that men usually leave married women alone and are inclined to treat all wives with respect. This is no great credit to married women. I am alone I am always alone no matter what. Some of my foster families used to send me to the movies to get me out of the house and there I\\'d sit all day and way into the night. Up in front, there with the screen so big, a little kid all alone, and I loved it. I loved anything that moved up there and I didn\\'t miss anything that happened and there was no popcorn either. A woman can\\'t be alone. She needs a man. A man and a woman support and strengthen each other. She just can\\'t do it by herself. I used to think as I looked out on the Hollywood night, \\'There must be thousands of girls sitting alone like me dreaming of being a movie star.\\' But I\\'m not going to worry about them. I\\'m dreaming the hardest. Reason is not automatic. Those who deny it cannot be conquered by it. Do not count on them. Leave them alone. The doer alone learneth. God writes the Gospel not in the Bible alone, but also on trees, and in the flowers and clouds and stars. There is danger that we lose sight of what our friend is absolutely, while considering what she is to us alone. No face which we can give to a matter will stead us so well at last as the truth. This alone wears well. I alone of English writers have consciously set myself to make music out of what I may call the sound of sense. It is far better to be alone, than to be in bad company. Being a child at home alone in the summer is a high-risk occupation. If you call your mother at work thirteen times an hour, she can hurt you. Ah, mon cher, for anyone who is alone, without God and without a master, the weight of days is dreadful. Without a family, man, alone in the world, trembles with the cold. \\x0cOften we can help each other most by leaving each other alone at other times we need the hand-grasp and the word of cheer. Grant that I may not pray alone with the mouth help me that I may pray from the depths of my heart. The time you spend alone with God will transform your character and increase your devotion. Then your integrity and godly behavior in an unbelieving world will make others long to know the Lord. When you are a mother, you are never really alone in your thoughts. A mother always has to think twice, once for herself and once for her child. Saving faith is an immediate relation to Christ, accepting, receiving, resting upon Him alone, for justification, sanctification, and eternal life by virtue of God\\'s grace. This is the highest wisdom that I own freedom and life are earned by those alone who conquer them each day anew. Wisdom alone is the science of other sciences. Man, alone, has the power to transform his thoughts into physical reality man, alone, can dream and make his dreams come true. Change alone is eternal, perpetual, immortal. Fashion is always of the time in which you live. It is not something standing alone. But the grand problem, the most important problem, is to rejeuvenate women. To make women look young. Then their outlook changes. They feel more joyous. Time, which alone makes the reputation of men, ends by making their defects respectable. Leadership is the other side of the coin of loneliness, and he who is a leader must always act alone. And acting alone, accept everything alone. Blood alone moves the wheels of history. What is uttered from the heart alone, Will win the hearts of others to your own. You are never so alone as when you are ill on stage. The most nightmarish feeling in the world is suddenly to feel like throwing up in front of four thousand people. I mean, I\\'ve always been a libertarian. Leave everybody alone. Let everybody else do what they want. Just stay out of everybody else\\'s hair. \\x0cEverything great in the world comes from neurotics. They alone have founded our religions and composed our masterpieces. The artist alone sees spirits. But after he has told of their appearing to him, everybody sees them. Man is a creature who lives not upon bread alone, but primarily by catchwords. Nothing else so destroys the power to stand alone as the habit of leaning upon others. If you lean, you will never be strong or original. Stand alone or bury your ambition to be somebody in the world. You that would judge me, do not judge alone this book or that, come to this hallowed place where my friends\\' portraits hang and look thereon Ireland\\'s history in their lineaments trace think where man\\'s glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such friends. Laugh and the world laughs with you, snore and you sleep alone. I like video games, but they are very violent. I want to create a video game in which you have to help all the characters who have died in the other games. \\'Hey, man, what are you playing?\\' \\'Super Busy Hospital. Could you leave me alone? I\\'m performing surgery! This guy got shot in the head, like, 27 times!\\' We are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of Nature has placed in our power... the battle, sir, is not to the strong alone it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Even though I love solar and love wind, like most people do, I like the renewable sources, they alone are not going to get America energy independent. There are two types of poor people, those who are poor together and those who are poor alone. The first are the true poor, the others are rich people out of luck. Your most precious, valued possessions and your greatest powers are invisible and intangible. No one can take them. You, and you alone, can give them. You will receive abundance for your giving. I like the idea of being alone. I like the idea of often being alone in all aspects of my life. I like to feel lonely. I like to need things. \\x0cIt seems that when you have cancer you are a brave battler against the disease, but when you have Alzheimer\\'s you are an old fart. That\\'s how people see you. It makes you feel quite alone. People used what they called a telephone because they hated being close together and they were scared of being alone. Jealousy is no more than feeling alone against smiling enemies. Too many Christians have a commitment of convenience. They\\'ll stay faithful as long as it\\'s safe and doesn\\'t involve risk, rejection, or criticism. Instead of standing alone in the face of challenge or temptation, they check to see which way their friends are going. If those committed to the quest fail, they will be forgiven. When lost, they will find another way. The moral imperative of humanism is the endeavor alone, whether successful or not, provided the effort is honorable and failure memorable.  Faith, mighty faith, the promise sees, And looks to God alone Laughs at impossibilities, And cries it shall be done. Our language has wisely sensed the two sides of being alone. It has created the word loneliness to express the pain of being alone. And it has created the word solitude to express the glory of being alone. Better mad with the rest of the world than wise alone. I do not believe that sheer suffering teaches. If suffering alone taught, all the world would be wise, since everyone suffers. To suffering must be added mourning, understanding, patience, love, openness and the willingness to remain vulnerable. Love alone is capable of uniting living beings in such a way as to complete and fulfill them, for it alone takes them and joins them by what is deepest in themselves. It is in moments of illness that we are compelled to recognize that we live not alone but chained to a creature of a different kingdom, whole worlds apart, who has no knowledge of us and by whom it is impossible to make ourselves understood: our body. \\x0cThe more decisions that you are forced to make alone, the more you are aware of your freedom to choose. Communication is a continual balancing act, juggling the conflicting needs for intimacy and independence. To survive in the world, we have to act in concert with others, but to survive as ourselves, rather than simply as cogs in a wheel, we have to act alone. I don\\'t think I could live without hair, makeup and styling, let alone be the performer I am. I am a glamour girl through and through. I believe in the glamorous life and I live one. Wisdom is not wisdom when it is derived from books alone. No employer today is independent of those about him. He cannot succeed alone, no matter how great his ability or capital. Business today is more than ever a question of cooperation. Just as a cautious businessman avoids investing all his capital in one concern, so wisdom would probably admonish us also not to anticipate all our happiness from one quarter alone.  Loneliness expresses the pain of being alone and solitude expresses the glory of being alone. None of us will ever accomplish anything excellent or commanding except when he listens to this whisper which is heard by him alone. In all history there is no war which was not hatched by the governments, the governments alone, independent of the interests of the people, to whom war is always pernicious even when successful. This, then, is the test we must set for ourselves not to march alone but to march in such a way that others will wish to join us. When I decided to be a singer, my mother warned me I\\'d be alone a lot. Basically we all are. Loneliness comes with life. Man alone is born crying, lives complaining, and dies disappointed. No nation can meet the world\\'s challenges alone. Knowledge rests not upon truth alone, but upon error also. Why is it you feel like a dope if you laugh alone, but that\\'s usually how you end up crying? \\x0cThe golden opportunity you are seeking is in yourself. It is not in your environment it is not in luck or chance, or the help of others it is in yourself alone. All conservatism is based upon the idea that if you leave things alone you leave them as they are. But you do not. If you leave a thing alone you leave it to a torrent of change. Doubt, of whatever kind, can be ended by action alone. Work alone is noble. It is good taste, and good taste alone, that possesses the power to sterilize and is always the first handicap to any creative functioning. I want to be with those who know secret things or else alone. The struggle alone pleases us, not the victory. Remember, man does not live on bread alone: sometimes he needs a little buttering up. A leader does not deserve the name unless he is willing occasionally to stand alone. No enterprise can exist for itself alone. It ministers to some great need, it performs some great service, not for itself, but for others or failing therein, it ceases to be profitable and ceases to exist. One man alone can be pretty dumb sometimes, but for real bona fide stupidity, there ain\\'t nothin\\' can beat teamwork. I want to be alone. Man\\'s ultimate concern must be expressed symbolically, because symbolic language alone is able to express the ultimate. There is no pleasure to me without communication: there is not so much as a sprightly thought comes into my mind that it does not grieve me to have produced alone, and that I have no one to tell it to. Grief can\\'t be shared. Everyone carries it alone. His own burden in his own way. Man does not live by soap alone and hygiene, or even health, is not much good unless you can take a healthy view of it or, better still, feel a healthy indifference to it. Freedom is the sure possession of those alone who have the courage to defend it. The radiation left over from the Big Bang is the same as that in your microwave oven but very much less powerful. It would heat your pizza only to minus 271.3*C - not much good for defrosting the pizza, let alone cooking it. \\x0cDon\\'t ever let economic alone determine your career or how you spend the majority of your time. It is the fight alone that pleases us, not the victory. We are not to give credit to the many, who say that none ought to be educated but the free but rather to the philosophers, who say that the well-educated alone are free. He travels the fastest who travels alone. It is great folly to wish to be wise all alone. If a man does not make new acquaintances as he advances through life, he will soon find himself left alone. A man, sir, should keep his friendship in a constant repair. A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality. Though nature be ever so generous, yet can she not make a hero alone. Fortune must contribute her part too and till both concur, the work cannot be perfected. The most boring scenes are the scenes where a character is alone. Earth teach me to forget myself as melted snow forgets its life. Earth teach me resignation as the leaves which die in the fall. Earth teach me courage as the tree which stands all alone. Earth teach me regeneration as the seed which rises in the spring. I tend to stay up late, not because I\\'m partying but because it\\'s the only time of the day when I\\'m alone and don\\'t have to be performing. Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone. No man will admire her the more, no woman will like her the better for it. Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter. To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, One clover, and a bee, And revery. The revery alone will do, If bees are few. Being an actor is the loneliest thing in the world. You are all alone with your concentration and imagination, and that\\'s all you have. As human beings, we need to know that we are not alone, that we are not crazy or completely out of our minds, that there are other people out there who feel as we do, live as we do, love as we do, who are like us. \\x0cWisdom comes alone through suffering. Children, dear and loving children, can alone console a woman for the loss of her beauty. A great source of calamity lies in regret and anticipation therefore a person is wise who thinks of the present alone, regardless of the past or future. One ever feels his twoness - an American, a Negro two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder. The foolish and the dead alone never change their opinions. Human beings should be held accountable. Leave God alone. He has enough problems. A well-instructed people alone can be permanently a free people. Success comes when people act together failure tends to happen alone. The belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary men alone are quite capable of every wickedness. I have grown up alone. I\\'ve taken care of myself. I worked, earned money and was independent at 18. Show me a man who lives alone and has a perpetually clean kitchen, and 8 times out of 9 I\\'ll show you a man with detestable spiritual qualities. I was sleeping the other night, alone, thanks to the exterminator. Take a course in good water and air and in the eternal youth of Nature you may renew your own. Go quietly, alone no harm will befall you. My mother was a professional sick person she took a lot of pain pills. There are many people like that. It\\'s just how they are used to getting attention. I always remember she\\'s the daughter of alcoholics who\\'d leave her alone at Christmas time. Self-reverence, self- knowledge, self-control these three alone lead one to sovereign power. Thank you for leaving us alone but giving us enough attention to boost our egos. The two operations of our understanding, intuition and deduction, on which alone we have said we must rely in the acquisition of knowledge. Better be alone than in bad company. \\x0cAll species capable of grasping this fact manage better in the struggle for existence than those which rely upon their own strength alone: the wolf, which hunts in a pack, has a greater chance of survival than the lion, which hunts alone. On stage I make love to twenty five thousand people and then I go home alone. Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. The man of genius is he and he alone who finds such joy in his art that he will work at it come hell or high water. The light of lights looks always on the motive, not the deed, the shadow of shadows on the deed alone. Then stirs the feeling infinite, so felt In solitude, where we are least alone. Change alone is unchanging. I\\'m not alone, I\\'m free. I no longer have to be a credit, I don\\'t have to be a symbol to anybody I don\\'t have to be a first to anybody. Plant and your spouse plants with you weed and you weed alone. The happiness of one\\'s own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul one must try to include, as necessary to one\\'s own happiness, the happiness of others. I had a very happy childhood, but I wasn\\'t that happy a child. I liked being alone and creating characters and voices. I think that\\'s when your creativity is developed, when you\\'re young. I liked the world of the imagination because it was an easy place to go to. The true and solid peace of nations consists not in equality of arms, but in mutual trust alone. The Christmas Song,\\' by Nat King Cole, is not only a masterful performance to me it just sounds like the holidays. I\\'ve never sung it, because Nat\\'s version is so perfect. I gotta leave it alone.;Harry Connick, Jr.;alone 1258;I was a queen, and you took away my crown a wife, and you killed my husband a mother, and you deprived me of my children.

Wodehouse;alone 1346;Talent alone won\\'t make you a success. Neither will being in the right place at the right time, unless you are ready. The most important question is: \\'Are your ready? Recommend to your children virtue that alone can make them happy, not gold. I\\'m a happy man, because I am successful in what I do, of course but what makes me most happy is I have people around me that I love and who love me back. This, for me, is the most important thing. Nobody likes to be alone. \\x0cTrue thoughts are those alone which do not understand themselves. No harm comes to man from outside alone: dumbness is the objective spirit. I have nothing to hide in art. The initial force alone can bring anyone to the end he must attain. We\\'re all in this alone. When they are alone they want to be with others, and when they are with others they want to be alone. After all, human beings are like that. This avidity alone, of acquiring goods and possessions for ourselves and our nearest friends, is insatiable, perpetual, universal, and directly destructive of society. If I want to be alone, some place I can write, I can read, I can pray, I can cry, I can do whatever I want - I go to the bathroom. It\\'s motive alone which gives character to the actions of men. I love clothes, but I don\\'t know what to put on myself, let alone others. I have a lot of help getting dressed. I know what men want. Men want to be really, really close to someone who will leave them alone. Sometimes, when I\\'m alone, I put on six inch heels and wear nothing else and dance around in front of the mirror and do my little stripper dance. If I\\'m alone too long I think too much, and I\\'m not interested in doing that. That won\\'t lead anywhere good, I\\'m sure. If I\\'m busy I tend to stay out of trouble. An idle mind is the devil\\'s playground. Probably only an art-worlder like me could assign deeper meaning to something as simple and silly as Tebowing. But, to us, anytime people repeat a stance or a little dance, alone or together, we see that it can mean something. Imagistic and unspoken language is our thing. There\\'s one Baldessari work I genuinely love and would like to own, maybe because of my Midwestern roots and love of driving alone. \\'The backs of all the trucks passed while driving from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara, California, Sunday, 20 January 1963\\' consists of a grid of 32 small color photographs depicting just what the title says. \\x0cThe only time I commit to conspiracy theories is when something way retarded happens. Like Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone. A task becomes a duty from the moment you suspect it to be an essential part of that integrity which alone entitles a man to assume responsibility. Getting through the nights is the toughest part. Being alone. Not having her there to talk to. Slump, and the world slumps with you. Push, and you push alone. We are so bound together that no man can labor for himself alone. Each blow he strikes in his own behalf helps to mold the universe. I think it\\'s interesting that \\'cologne\\' rhymes with \\'alone.\\' Your experiences will be yours alone. But truth and best friendship will rarely if ever disappoint you. Another thing I like to do is sit back and take in nature. To look at the birds, listen to their singing, go hiking, camping and jogging and running, walking along the beach, playing games and sometimes being alone with the great outdoors. It\\'s very special to me. When I was producing on my own, I was doing it in order to - in a very patriarchal entertainment industry, let alone planet - very much hell- bent on trying to prove to myself, if nothing else, that I could do it as a woman. I was always such a people- watcher. I would sit on street corners alone and watch people and make up stories about them in my head. Then, all of a sudden, I was the one being watched. Fear of serious injury alone cannot justify oppression of free speech and assembly. Men feared witches and burnt women. It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears. Education alone can conduct us to that enjoyment which is, at once, best in quality and infinite in quantity. I have the handicap of being born with a special language to which I alone have the key. We all get stuck. We all lose ourselves a little bit in a fantasy or in our jobs and forget how we feel about other things. It\\'s really important to check yourself, to spend some time alone. Is it not by love alone that we succeed in penetrating to the very essence of being? \\x0cIndia is the meeting place of the religions and among these Hinduism alone is by itself a vast and complex thing, not so much a religion as a great diversified and yet subtly unified mass of spiritual thought, realization and aspiration. The strong man is strongest when alone. We were alone. Where, I could not say, hardly imagine. All was black, and such a dense black that, after some minutes, my eyes had not been able to discern even the faintest glimmer. A man is never completely alone in this world. At the worst, he has the company of a boy, a youth, and by and by a grown man - the one he used to be. I was passionate. I found something that I loved. I could be all alone in a big old skating rink and nobody could get near me and I didn\\'t have to talk to anybody because of my shyness. It was great. I was in my fantasy world. To stand up on a stage alone with an acoustic guitar requires bravery bordering on heroism. Bordering on insanity. I\\'m a teenager, but I\\'m independent - I have my own apartment, I have my own life. And I think I have learned more than any of those teenagers have in school. I learned to be responsible, leaving my family and coming here alone. Offspring, the due performance on religious rites, faithful service, highest conjugal happiness and heavenly bliss for the ancestors and oneself, depend on one\\'s wife alone. Look at the Afghans, during the time of the Soviet invasion. They were among the poorest Muslims in the world, yet they were sustained by their faith in God, and God alone. Testing oneself is best when done alone. Had the United States and the United Kingdom gone on alone to capture Baghdad, under the provisions of the Geneva and Hague conventions we would have been considered occupying powers and therefore would have been responsible for all the costs of maintaining or restoring government, education and other services for the people of Iraq. \\x0cNow suddenly there was nothing but a world of cloud, and we three were there alone in the middle of a great white plain with snowy hills and mountains staring at us and it was very still but there were whispers. Look, if I were alone in the world, I would have the right to choose despair, solitude and self-fulfillment. But I am not alone. For me, growing up, the downside of it was that as a kid you don\\'t want to stand out. You don\\'t want to have a famous father let alone get a job because of your famous father, you know? But I\\'m a product of nepotism. That\\'s how I got my foot in the door, through my dad. While the resurrection promises us a new and perfect life in the future, God loves us too much to leave us alone to contend with the pain, guilt and loneliness of our present life. The most terrifying thing I can think of is being alone - and I mean utterly alone, like no one else in the world alone - at night. That\\'s the nucleus of the first story in my collection and it\\'s also where the title came from for the book. No one ever said on their deathbed, \\'Gee, I wish I had spent more time alone with my computer\\'. Love alone could waken love. I never did anything alone. Whatever was accomplished in this country was accomplished collectively. There\\'s a lot of people out there who go through hard times, and they feel alone. They feel like nobody is there. But I\\'m in the same boat. I need, absolutely, to be alone. If Galileo had said in verse that the world moved, the inquisition might have let him alone. Even if I have to stand alone, I will not be afraid to stand alone. I\\'m going to fight for you. I\\'m going to fight for what\\'s right. I\\'m going to fight to hold people accountable. I have an internal protectiveness where it\\'s like, if it comes to just me, as frightened as I am of losing someone I love or things going sour or simply being alone, there is a dark place in my brain where I\\'m like, It could happen and I\\'m okay, I\\'m prepared. \\x0cI live alone, with cats, books, pictures, fresh vegetables to cook, the garden, the hens to feed. On stage, I make love to 25,000 different people, then I go home alone. Alone I\\'m nothing. I have a huge, active imagination, and I think I\\'m really scared of being alone because if I\\'m left to my own devices, I\\'ll just turn into a madwoman. I don\\'t like being in houses alone. Our world is so glutted with useless information, images, useless images, sounds, all this sort of thing. It\\'s a cacophony, it\\'s like a madness I think that\\'s been happening in the past twenty- five years. And I think anything that can help a person sit in a room alone and not worry about it is good. Happiness is spiritual, born of truth and love. It is unselfish therefore it cannot exist alone, but requires all mankind to share it. You could say, in a vulgar Freudian way, that I am the unhappy child who escapes into books. Even as a child, I was most happy being alone. This has not changed. Can anyone understand how it is to have lived in the White House and then, suddenly, to be living alone as the President\\'s widow? I\\'m very shy really. I spend a lot of time in my room alone reading or writing or watching television. I have no time for those who say there is no way Scotland could go it alone. I know first- hand the contribution Scotland and Scots make to Britain\\'s success - so for me there\\'s no question about whether Scotland could be an independent nation. Comics, for me, is being able to sing alone in the shower. I find it freeing. You just pick up a pen and get to it. If I was writing songs just for me I\\'d only play them in my living room, alone. The principal contributor to loneliness in this country is television. What happens is that the family \\'gets together\\' alone. And I find - I\\'m 63, and my capacity to be by myself and just spend time by myself hasn\\'t diminished any. That\\'s the necessary part of being a writer, you better like being alone. \\x0cYou have to have enough respect for other human beings to leave their lives alone. If you admire that life, build it for yourself. Don\\'t just try to come in and take somebody else\\'s life. Life\\'s an awfully lonesome affair. You come into the world alone and you go out of the world alone yet it seems to me you are more alone while living than even going and coming. Friends are very important to me, and I have always had many of them. There are probably many reasons why this is so, but two seem to me more valid than any of the others I am a naturally friendly person, and I hate to be alone. The prospect of success in achieving our most cherished dream is not without its terrors. Who is more deprived and alone than the man who has achieved his dream? It is clear that not in one thing alone, but in many ways equality and freedom of speech are a good thing. Mass transportation is doomed to failure in North America because a person\\'s car is the only place where he can be alone and think. The majority does not rule in America, but the minority shouldn\\'t hijack it. And it\\'s because we\\'re afraid. They have isolated us and made us feel as though we\\'re alone. We\\'re not. Belief is nothing but a more vivid, lively, forcible, firm, steady conception of an object, than what the imagination alone is ever able to attain. You can\\'t walk alone. Many have given the illusion, but none have really walked alone. Man is not made that way. Each man is bedded in his people, their history, their culture, and their values. The primary distinction of the artist is that he must actively cultivate that state which most men, necessarily, must avoid the state of being alone. I\\'ve always had a huge fear of dying or becoming ill. The thing I\\'m most afraid of, though, is being alone, which I think a lot of performers fear. It\\'s why we seek the limelight - so we\\'re not alone, were adored. We\\'re loved, so people want to be around us. The fear of being alone drives my life. \\x0cWe can recognize the dawn and the decline of love by the uneasiness we feel when alone together. We neither laugh alone, nor weep alone, why then should we pray alone? Where I come from, it was a heresy to say you wanted to be in movies, leave alone American movies. Man does not live by words alone, despite the fact that sometimes he has to eat them. Journalists do not live by words alone, although sometimes they have to eat them. But there comes a moment in everybody\\'s life when he must decide whether he\\'ll live among the human beings or not - a fool among fools or a fool alone. All we ask is to be let alone. I can\\'t really define it in sexual terms alone although our sexuality is so energizing why not enjoy it too? As strong as the United States is, we can\\'t deal with terrorism alone. I love my friends and family, but I also love it when they can\\'t find me and I can spend all day reading or walking all alone, in silence, eight thousand miles away from everyone. All alone and unreachable in a foreign country is one my most favorite possible things to be. Work alone will efface the footsteps of work. A steady patriot of the world alone, The friend of every country but his own. I get a friend to travel with me... I need somebody to bring me back to who I am. It\\'s hard to be alone. The average Nigerian person has come to reconcile himself with the fact that his or her social progress remain essentially in his or her hands in collaboration with other fellow Nigerians and not merely relying on what government alone could provide for him or her. I have never been able to grasp the meaning of time. I don\\'t believe it exists. I\\'ve felt this again and again, when alone and out in nature. On such occasions, time does not exist. Nor does the future exist. And what\\'s more I\\'ve got no need for anyone to tell me how to do it. I am not interested. You act how you want to and leave me alone to do my own thing. \\x0cU2 is an original species... there are colours and feelings and emotional terrain that we occupy that is ours and ours alone. No one else can take risks for us, or face our losses on our behalf, or give us self-esteem. No one can spare us from life\\'s slings and arrows, and when death comes, we meet it alone. I don\\'t like to work with assistants. I\\'m already one too many the camera alone would be enough. I want to be alone and work until the day my heads hits the drawing table and I\\'m dead. Kaput. I feel very much like I want to be with my brother and sister again. They\\'re nowhere. I know they\\'re nowhere and they don\\'t exist, but if nowhere means that\\'s where they are, that\\'s where I want to be. Simply by not owning three medium-sized castles in Tuscany I have saved enough money in the last forty years on insurance premiums alone to buy a medium-sized castle in Tuscany. Men, even when alone, lighten their labors by song, however rude it may be. I once had a boyfriend who couldn\\'t write unless he was wearing a necktie and a dress shirt, which I thought was really weird, because this was a long time ago, and no one I knew ever wore dress shirts, let alone neckties it was like he was a grown-up reenacter or something. When we dream alone it is only a dream, but when many dream together it is the beginning of a new reality. Unhappy, let alone angry, religious people provide more persuasive arguments for atheism and secularism than do all the arguments of atheists. If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a state has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his house, what books he may read or what films he may watch. The history of philosophy is not, like the history of the sciences, to be studied with the intellect alone. That which is receptive in us and that which impinges upon us from history is the reality of man\\'s being, unfolding itself in thought. \\x0cI\\'m a dad, and I no longer see a way for my kids to even inherit the money that I\\'m making, let alone go out there, have an idea, and create it in their own lifetime. It\\'s kind of awkward to eat alone in a restaurant because everybody\\'s looking at me. Be able to live alone, even if you don\\'t want to and think you will never find it necessary. The age in which we live, this non-stop distraction, is making it more impossible for the young generation to ever have the curiosity or discipline... because you need to be alone to find out anything. I think more and more people want to live alone. You can be a couple without being in each other\\'s pockets. I don\\'t see why you have to share the same bathroom. I absolutely relate to being alone in squalor, trying to come up with something adequate. I relate to that, and I\\'ve been known to crawl out of bed and drink out of a 2-liter bottle of Diet Coke. After all my various relationships I find myself now home alone. Deliberation is the work of many men. Action, of one alone. Worse there cannot be a better, I believe, there may be, by giving energy to the capital and skill of the country to produce exports, by increasing which, alone, can we flatter ourselves with the prospect of finding employment for that part of our population now unemployed. War alone brings up to their highest tension all human energies and imposes the stamp of nobility upon the peoples who have the courage to make it. I never knew I\\'d be in a musical, let alone win an award for one. Happy the man, and happy he alone, he who can call today his own he who, secure within, can say, tomorrow do thy worst, for I have lived today. For the last third of life there remains only work. It alone is always stimulating, rejuvenating, exciting and satisfying. \\x0cI got a lot of problems, but I\\'m really good at intuiting what I need to do to be happy with whatever I create. I know when to stop myself, I know when to start, I know when to leave something alone. I guess I just kind of indulge that completely, and so I just take my time. It\\'s important for moms to have alone time. However, that\\'s the first thing that goes on a busy day. Fortunately for me, because of my job, I have to find the time to do it. At least that\\'s the way my mind sees it. We cannot remember too often that when we observe nature, and especially the ordering of nature, it is always ourselves alone we are observing. Photography, alone of the arts, seems perfected to serve the desire humans have for a moment - this very moment - to stay. In Turkey, you\\'re not allowed to be left alone in the hospital. The nurse teaches the family how to do things, and somebody is always there with the patient. A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is a reality. Death is the mother of Beauty hence from her, alone, shall come fulfillment to our dreams and our desires. In Sleep we lie all naked and alone, in Sleep we are united at the heart of night and darkness, and we are strange and beautiful asleep for we are dying the darkness and we know no death. Schizophrenia beats dining alone. When one by one our ties are torn, and friend from friend is snatched forlorn when man is left alone to mourn, oh! then how sweet it is to die! When I get into bed at night, I hope I don\\'t get into it alone! You need a whole community to raise a child. I have raised two children, alone. An American, a Negro... two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder. Weird people follow you in the streets, you can\\'t sit alone in a restaurant or a cafe and read a book in peace, and I think everybody values those moments of being alone. \\x0cIt may, however, be said that the level of experience to which concepts are inapplicable cannot yield any knowledge of a universal character, for concepts alone are capable of being socialized. Inductive reason, which alone makes man master of his environment, is an achievement and when once born it must be reinforced by inhibiting the growth of other modes of knowledge. I\\'m so accustomed to being alone. When I\\'m alone, I work sometimes with music, sometimes without and sometimes just listening to NPR. What I\\'m trying to do is get this message out about self- empowerment, entrepreneurial spirit and true Americanism - the way we were when we changed the world, when Edison was alone, failing his 2,000th time on the lightbulb. A country is made not by policy alone, but by its music, its entertainment shows, all of it. I thought about how we need to make children feel that there are times in their lives when they need to be alone and quiet and to be able to accept their aloneness. I think about dying. I\\'ve come to realize we all die alone in one way or another. Because for whatever reason, even though I want to stay home all the time and be left alone, I want to tell the world who I am now. I love the solitude of being on a plane and finally getting to read an entire book and being left alone. I don\\'t think I ever got the hang of the writers\\' room. I love collaborating with people, but I really do my best work alone, and I think I would want to - if I did something again, I think I\\'d want to take total ownership the way Aaron Sorkin or David Kelley does. Fear of error which everything recalls to me at every moment of the flight of my ideas, this mania for control, makes men prefer reason\\'s imagination to the imagination of the senses. And yet it is always the imagination alone which is at work. Work, apart from devotion or love of God, is helpless and cannot stand alone. I was never less alone than when by myself. \\x0cThe attempt to devote oneself to literature alone is a most deceptive thing, and often, paradoxically, it is literature that suffers for it.  Our future cannot depend on the government alone. The ultimate solutions lie in the attitudes and the actions of the American people. People talk about the conscience, but it seems to me one must just bring it up to a certain point and leave it there. You can let your conscience alone if you\\'re nice to the second housemaid. Those who remember Washington\\'s cold war culture in the 1980s will recall the shocked reactions to Reagan\\'s intervention. People interested in foreign policy were astonished when in 1985 he met alone at Geneva - alone, not a single strategic thinker at his elbow! - with the Soviet Communist master Gorbachev. Palin was a political Hail Mary, a long bomb in the closing minutes of a game that John McCain and Co. were certain to lose. They didn\\'t care if she had the policy or political or emotional capacity to serve as vice president, let alone president. They were willing to drive the country off a cliff, if that\\'s what it took to win. This, and this alone, is Christianity, a universal holiness in every part of life, a heavenly wisdom in all our actions, not conforming to the spirit and temper of the world but turning all worldly enjoyments into means of piety and devotion to God. The Fuhrer alone is the present and future German reality and its law. Learn to know ever more deeply: from now on every single thing demands decision, and every action responsibility. Fail I alone, in words and deeds? Why, all men strive and who succeeds? Finds progress, man\\'s distinctive mark alone, Not God\\'s, and not the beast\\'s God is, they are, Man partly is, and wholly hopes to be. Liberal that I am, I support health-care reform on its merits alone. My liberal blood boils, for example, when I read that half of the personal bankruptcies in this country are brought on, in part, by medical expenses. I don\\'t think nationalism is alone holding the field it\\'s in contention with a lot of different things. \\x0cI am alone, some people help me, but, basically, I can do what I want.  I mean, I don\\'t think I\\'m alone when I look at the homeless person or the bum or the psychotic or the drunk or the drug addict or the criminal and see their baby pictures in my mind\\'s eye. You don\\'t think they were cute like every other baby? It is the unknown that excites the ardor of scholars, who, in the known alone, would shrivel up with boredom. Most high courts in other nations do not have discretion, such as we enjoy, in selecting the cases that the high court reviews. Our court is virtually alone in the amount of discretion it has. Yes, I will bring the understanding of a woman to the Court, but I doubt that alone will affect my decisions. With production alone as the goal, industry in North America was dominated by the assembly line, standardization for mass consumption. The music industry is a strange combination of having real and intangible assets: pop bands are brand names in themselves, and at a given stage in their careers their name alone can practically gaurantee hit records. It would do the world good if every man would compel himself occasionally to be absolutely alone. Most of the world s progress has come out of such loneliness. And if you don\\'t believe the sun will rise, stand alone and greet the coming night in the last remaining light. A celibate, like the fly in the heart of an apple, dwells in a perpetual sweetness, but sits alone, and is confined and dies in singularity. He alone is free who lives with free consent under the entire guidance of reason. Only that thing is free which exists by the necessities of its own nature, and is determined in its actions by itself alone. Wisdom alone is true ambition\\'s aim, wisdom is the source of virtue and of fame obtained with labour, for mankind employed, and then, when most you share it, best enjoyed. My contribution I hope is to get people to eat full-flavored food. If I could come away with that alone, that would be a fantastic accomplishment. I\\'m also very proud of being a very American chef. \\x0cBut no nation can base its survival and development on luck and prayers alone while its leadership fritters away every available opportunity for success and concrete achievement. Solitude is strength to depend on the presence of the crowd is weakness. The man who needs a mob to nerve him is much more alone than he imagines. He was thinking alone, and seriously racking his brain to find a direction for this single force four times multiplied, with which he did not doubt, as with the lever for which Archimedes sought, they should succeed in moving the world, when some one tapped gently at his door. When I decided to be a singer, my mother warned me I\\'d be alone a lot. Basically we all are. And remember don\\'t high post when you\\'re far from home, and high posting when you\\'re all alone. Go on thinking that you don\\'t need to be read and you\\'ll find that it may become quite true: no one will feel the need tom read it because it is written for yourself alone and the public won\\'t feel any impulse to gate crash such a private party. Being alone is scarier than any boogey man and the reason why I don\\'t choose to see Horror movies as a rule. I have been alone since my husband died. I stay in my home. I don\\'t date. It\\'s hard to date when you\\'re at home. Nobody knows you. I\\'d like to state that Spike Lee is not saying that African American culture is just for black people alone to enjoy and cherish. Culture is for everybody. Once a disease has entered the body, all parts which are healthy must fight it: not one alone, but all. Because a disease might mean their common death. Nature knows this and Nature attacks the disease with whatever help she can muster. The progress of evolution from President Washington to President Grant was alone evidence to upset Darwin. I\\'m the most gregarious of men and love good company, but never less alone when alone. \\x0cThe daily act of writing remains as demanding and maddening as it was before, and the pleasure you get from writing - rare but profound - remains at the true heart of the enterprise. On their best days, writers all over the world are winning Pulitzers, all alone in their studios, with no one watching. Costumes and scenery alone will not attract audiences. There are times when the only access I have to the truest person that I am is when I\\'m alone and trying to solve a sentence. It\\'s exciting, even when it\\'s frustrating, even when I can\\'t do it right. Well, I\\'m not a member of the permanent political establishment, and I\\'ve learned quickly these last few days that if you\\'re not a member in good standing of the Washington elite, then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified for that reason alone. Successful crimes alone are justified. Reason is a crutch for age, but youth is strong enough to walk alone. Volume depends precisely on the writer\\'s having been able to sit in a room every day, year after year, alone. Still, intuitive assumptions about behavior is only the starting point of systematic analysis, for alone they do not yield many interesting implications. The writer is all alone. If you write a novel alone you sit and you weave a little narrative. And it\\'s O.K., but it\\'s of no account. There is no end to the violations committed by children on children, quietly talking alone. Never to lie is to have no lock on your door, you are never wholly alone. Muslims must believe that all power, success and victory comes from God alone. If man knew how women pass the time when they are alone, they\\'d never marry. I don\\'t like being alone. You can be around 100 people and be completely alone. People don\\'t realize what it\\'s really like. That we find a crystal or a poppy beautiful means that we are less alone, that we are more deeply inserted into existence than the course of a single life would lead us to believe. \\x0cOne of the places where we lived when I was growing up had this big wood out the back. And starting when I was about 8, I used to enjoy just walking alone through the wood late. Eleven p.m. Midnight. Later. Others indeed may talk, and write, and fight about liberty, and make an outward pretence to it but the free- thinker alone is truly free. Writers may be disreputable, incorrigible, early to decay or late to bloom but they dare to go it alone. I love my government not least for the extent to which it leaves me alone. For every quarrel a man and wife have before others, they have a hundred when alone. I\\'m not someone who likes to have my picture taken, let alone see it plastered all over the place. Benevolence alone will not make a teacher, nor will learning alone do it. The gift of teaching is a peculiar talent, and implies a need and a craving in the teacher himself. It\\'s important to say that actors can\\'t act alone, it\\'s impossible. What we have to do is support each other. In the laughing times we know that we are lucky, and in the quiet times we know that we are blessed. And we will not be alone. The flesh endures the storms of the present alone the mind, those of the past and future as well as the present. Gluttony is a lust of the mind. Every animal leaves traces of what it was man alone leaves traces of what he created. The only way to get gay issues off the front pages of Canadian newspapers is to grant gay and lesbian people our full civil equality and leave it alone. I do not come bearing a party label on my sleeve - or a quick fix in my back pocket. I do not come with a rigid ideology in my heart - or a soul that tells me to go it alone. I do not come to uproot tradition - or to be imprisoned by it. I\\'m a grown woman and sometimes, I might be a little fat, you know? Am I alone there? Not really. From 18 to 22, I was alone, living in L.A. with a bunch of friends, partying. \\x0cWe talk a lot on \\'Biggest Loser\\' about how fitness is a natural antidepressant, how it burns off stress. What I like about running is that it gives me time alone. I\\'m always busy, with people at work, with my kids. I love getting out for a run by myself and just listening to my music. Britain, relative to the U.S., is a highly secular society. Philanthropy alone cannot fill the gap left by government cutbacks. And the sources of altruism go deep into our evolutionary past. As a young man, even if I was going to see a play or a film by myself, I didn\\'t feel like I was alone. There was something that was unfolding up there that brought me into it. And I recognised that. For those two hours, it made me feel like I belonged to something really good. Solitude, though it may be silent as light, is like light, the mightiest of agencies for solitude is essential to man. All men come into this world alone and leave it alone. Most of these people who are celebrities now don\\'t do anything to deserve it, so by that fact alone, I don\\'t want to be one. Men don\\'t even ask me out. I can\\'t remember the last time I was asked out on a date, and I\\'m talking years here. I spend my life more and more alone. I couldn\\'t even go to the bathroom alone. My mother or a social worker always went with me. I wrote and produced millions and millions of selling records, so my publishing company alone was worth millions of dollars. I didn\\'t have to work anymore in life because when the rappers started sampling... I\\'m the most sampled artist in history. I would hope that understanding and reconciliation are not limited to the 19th hole alone. I\\'m not at the point where I\\'d feel safe in a house alone. I would be really scared. I\\'m the kind of person that when I get up to go use the bathroom I have this big long hallway, and I just know someone\\'s going to jump out and get me. To be adult is to be alone. I\\'m not a rock star. Sure I am, to a certain extent because of the situation, but when kids ask me how it feels to be a rock star, I say leave me alone, I\\'m not a rock star. I\\'m not in it for the fame, I\\'m in it because I like to play. \\x0cI may be alone in this, but I do sense the power of film, in that movies have the ability to literally change people\\'s minds. That\\'s pretty powerful stuff when you consider that. The thing I like about baseball is that it\\'s one-on-one. You stand up there alone, and if you make a mistake, it\\'s your mistake. If you hit a home run, it\\'s your home run. In the first 50 years of the filibuster, it was used only 35 times. But the last Congress alone had 112 cloture motions filed, plus threats of more. This is the tyranny of the minority. Perhaps our own opposition to even the level of European integration we have now, let alone any more, is well known. My learning process is by eye alone it\\'s not at all scientific. As a child, I wanted only two things - to be left alone to read my library books, and to get away from my provincial hometown and go to London to be a writer. And I always knew that when I got there, I wanted to make loads of money. Surely being a Professional Beauty - let alone an ageing one - is one of the most insecure and doomed careers imaginable. But we cannot rely on memorials and museums alone. We can tell ourselves we will never forget and we likely won\\'t. But we need to make sure that we teach history to those who never had the opportunity to remember in the first place. I feel so good after a workout. Any time you can be alone with yourself is really important. I tried acupuncture, the patch, and hypnosis, but found that I needed to do it alone - when the time was right for me. I think sometimes if you are alone, you are freer because your time is your own. One person alone can\\'t do anything as important as bringing genuine democracy to a country. No one should be left to suffer alone. When you work alone, you need to socialize at some level. I must try and break through the cliches about Latin America. Superpowers and other outsiders have fought over us for centuries in ways that have nothing to do with our problems. In reality we are all alone. \\x0cThe right to be let alone is indeed the beginning of all freedoms. Yeah, my dream would be to work for 6 months and then have 6 months to play, just snowboarding, surfing, and going to cool places to listen and be alone and kinda chill out. Making checklists of things you\\'re looking for in a person is the numero uno thing you can do to guarantee you\\'ll be alone forever. I\\'m a very brave person. I can go to North Vietnam, I can challenge my government, but I can\\'t challenge the man I\\'m with if means I\\'m going to end up alone. When the traveler goes alone he gets acquainted with himself. At the root of the shy temperament is a deep fear of social judgment, one so severe it can sometimes be crippling. Introverted people don\\'t worry unduly about whether they\\'ll be found wanting, they just find too much socializing exhausting and would prefer either to be alone or in the company of a select few people. Virtue alone has majesty in death. Probably nothing serious or worthwhile can be accomplished without one\\'s willingness to be alone for sustained periods of time, which is not to say that one must live alone, obsessively. I\\'m fiercely independent, but I\\'m also terrified of being alone. As a child, I had to get up early for school or work. I\\'d get ready by myself. I\\'d set my alarm to wake me up very early in the morning, and be off to work, the family driver driving me every morning. I did it alone, my parents never coming in to wake me up. It is eerie being all but alone in Westminster Abbey. Without the tourists, there are only the dead, many of them kings and queens. They speak powerfully and put my thoughts into vivid perspective. Let me alone, and go in search of someone else. Life is only a long and bitter suicide, and faith alone can transform this suicide into a sacrifice. \\x0cFor so long as the Jew has even one ally, he will be convinced - in his smallness of mind - that his salvation came from that ally. It is only when he is alone - against all of his own efforts and frantic attempts - that he will, through no choice, be compelled to turn to G-d. But it seems that the judging maybe they shouldn\\'t at least see the practices all week long. That can taint the way they go into the judging and the outlook of what\\'s going to happen, instead of just watching those four minutes and judging on those minutes alone. No one chooses to raise children alone. I\\'m not saying that there\\'s anything better than mated bliss at its best, but I\\'m saying that living alone is as good in its own way. But we haven\\'t quite given ourselves permission to recognize that. It was either Voltaire or Charlie Sheen who said, \\'We are born alone. We live alone. We die alone. And anything in between that can give us the illusion that we\\'re not, we cling to.\\' Most bands don\\'t even last fourteen months let alone fourteen years. I was very happy sitting alone at a dining room table, writing a script. It\\'s always easier if you have the support of your family, if you\\'re not alone. I came from a country that has been through a lot of troubles in the last 20 to 30 years, but we have been through them together. It\\'s an amazing feeling to go into a studio and really be alone. Not drunk is he who from the floor - Can rise alone and still drink more But drunk is They, who prostrate lies, Without the power to drink or rise. Whatever my individual desires were to be free, I was not alone. There were many others who felt the same way. I\\'m never less at leisure than when at leisure, or less alone than when alone. I\\'m ultimately a widow and a single mother, who\\'s not even getting to be a mother right now. I am so alone, it\\'s freaky. I have my best ideas when I am alone. \\x0cI learned why \\'out riding alone\\' is an oxymoron: An equestrian is never alone, is always sensing the other being, the mysterious but also understandable living being that is the horse. When I walked to school in the mornings I would start out alone but would pick up four other boys along the way. We would set out together after school across the village green. You can\\'t get rid of it with exercise alone. You can do the most vigorous exercise and only burn up 300 calories in an hour. If you\\'ve got fat on your body, the exercise firms and tones the muscles. But when you use that tape measure, what makes it bigger? It\\'s the fat! I\\'m not into watching stuff I did last week, let alone three or four years ago. The accumulation of skill and science which has been directed to diminish the difficulty of producing manufactured goods, has not been beneficial to that country alone in which it is concentrated distant kingdoms have participated in its advantages. Photography can never grow up if it imitates some other medium. It has to walk alone it has to be itself. Postmodernism surely requires an even greater grasp of symbolism, as it\\'s increasingly an art of gesture alone. I try to push ideas away, and the ones that will not leave me alone are the ones that ultimately end up happening. Writing is a solitary occupation. Family, friends, and society are the natural enemies of the writer. He must be alone, uninterrupted, and slightly savage if he is to sustain and complete an undertaking. I\\'m a workaholic. Before long I\\'m traveling on my nervous energy alone. This is incredibly exhausting. I had to weave and play around with a honey bear, you know, and I could wrestle with him a little bit, but there\\'s no way you can even wrestle a honey bear, let alone a grizzly bear that\\'s standing ten feet to eleven feet tall! Can you imagine? But it was fascinating to work that close to that kind of animal. \\x0cWomen are smart in business and dumb in love. They won\\'t date outside their zip code, let alone outside the city. They are city snobs. However, anyone to whom this happens should not leave his room upon awakening, should speak to no-one, but remain alone and sober until everything comes back to him, and he recalls the dream. The question is what will Mitt Romney do as president if his policy is simply to be hands off and let the government be made so small it can be drowned in a bathtub. In the 21st century global economy, no state alone has the ability to compete against China. I was a little doubtful about the propriety of going to the Mammoth Cave without a gentleman escort, but if two ladies travel alone they must have the courage of men. You can work on the saxophone alone, but ultimately you must perform with others. I\\'m really lucky that my record companies have been patient with me and leave me alone and give me the time to make it right in my mind. I think sometimes all you need is to hear someone else say the same thing that you\\'re going through to realize that you\\'re not alone. I try to put some sense of hope into the songs, into whatever the situation is so that it\\'s not just dirt, drudgery and a life of misery. It\\'s only when you\\'re alone that you realize where you are. You have nothing to fall back on except your own resources. The best part about being with a group is that you don\\'t have to do everything alone. You\\'re with your friends. In a civilized society, all crimes are likely to be sins, but most sins are not and ought not to be treated as crimes. Man\\'s ultimate responsibility is to God alone. People love pretty much the same things best. A writer looking for subjects inquires not after what he loves best, but after what he alone loves at all. Buddhism notes that it is always a mistake to think your soul can go it alone. Good acting is all in the writing. If it isn\\'t on the page, then it really won\\'t make any difference. You cannot act on force of personality alone. \\x0cI just broke up with my boyfriend, and I\\'ve been spending more time alone than I\\'d like. I live to hail that season by gifted one foretold, when men shall live by reason, and not alone by gold. Man cannot live by incompetence alone. The power of a book lies in its power to turn a solitary act into a shared vision. As long as we have books, we are not alone. I know that books I have written will still resonate in 50 years - particularly \\'My Sister\\'s Keeper.\\' It has sold three million copies in the States alone. I strongly feel that, as a novelist, you have a platform and the ability to change people\\'s minds. With fame there is a crosswire between intensity and intimacy. You have decoy intimacy, but you are also very much alone. Do not rely completely on any other human being, however dear. We meet all life\\'s greatest tests alone. In the country of pain we are each alone. People like eccentrics. Therefore they will leave me alone, saying that I am a mad clown. If you would have your son to walk honourably through the world, you must not attempt to clear the stones from his path, but teach him to walk firmly over them - not insist upon leading him by the hand, but let him learn to go alone.  All still lifes are actually paintings of the world on the sixth day of creation, when God and the world were alone together, without man! I\\'m a huge Wes Anderson fan I would faint if I met him, let alone got to work with him. Forbidden pleasures alone are loved immoderately when lawful, they do not excite desire. As regards parents, I should like to see them as highly educated as possible, and I do not restrict this remark to fathers alone. Government alone cannot solve the problems we deal with in our correctional facilities, treatment centers, homeless shelters and crisis centers - we need our faith- based and community partners. \\x0cWhoever wants to know something about me - as an artist which alone is significant - they should look attentively at my pictures and there seek to recognise what I am and what I want. Let your mind alone, and see what happens. I rise to taste the dawn, and find that love alone will shine today. If men knew how women pass the time when they are alone, they\\'d never marry. Americans different in some maybe thoughts or emphasis still have the same ideas. They want a government that lets them be free, that leaves them alone, that doesn\\'t interrupt and interfere with every aspect of their life, that lets them go to work and keep more of what they\\'ve worked hard to have. A good government may, indeed, redress the grievances of an injured people but a strong people can alone build up a great nation. I made some friends at Listerine and they taught me a little bit about oral care. That half of adults suffer from oral disease, that the number one chronic disease among children is oral disease, that we\\'re only taking care of 25% of our mouths when brushing alone and there are more germs in your mouth than there are people on the planet. I would point out that I\\'m an actress for a reason! If I were popular in high school, I would have considered another career because I wouldn\\'t have been alone in my room, making up other characters for myself. I definitely had growing pains. The popular kids didn\\'t want anything to do with the girl who was starting the drama club.  Some players you pat their butts, some players you kick their butts, some players you leave alone. My overcoat is worn out my shirts also are worn out. And I ask to be allowed to have a lamp in the evening it is indeed wearisome sitting alone in the dark. As for style, there is something about the way musicians dress-they seem to be able to create their own world within their fashion alone. \\x0cOne definition of eternity is that we are not alone on this planet, that there are those who\\'ve gone before and those who will come, and that there is a community of spirits. I think Mr. Wilson will have to be the rest of the way alone. In art, all who have done something other than their predecessors have merited the epithet of revolutionary and it is they alone who are masters. In truth, I am a single mother. But I don\\'t feel alone at all in parenting my daughter. Krishna has a whole other side of her family who loves her, too. And so Krishna is parented by me, but also by her grandmother and aunts and cousins and uncles and friends. No one can arrive from being talented alone, work transforms talent into genius. In the U.S. alone, weather disasters caused $50 billion in economic damages in 2010. Style used to be an interaction between the human soul and tools that were limiting. In the digital era, it will have to come from the soul alone. What does it mean to not be alone? I\\'ve approached that question through music, technology, writing and other means. I understand and get when kids and teenagers feel like they\\'re alone and it\\'s not going to get better. My advice is that there is a support system out there, there are a lot of people who have been through what you\\'re going through and are going through it now. No enterprise, small or large, public or private, can remain self-governing, let alone successful, so deeply in hock to others as we are about to be.  The methods by which a trade union can alone act, are necessarily destructive its organization is necessarily tyrannical. Our country will, I believe, sooner forgive an officer for attacking an enemy than for letting it alone. To share our stories is not only a worthwhile endeavor for the storyteller, but for those who hear our stories and feel less alone because of it. The English Bible - a book which, if everything else in our language should perish, would alone suffice to show the whole extent of its beauty and power. \\x0cThe object of oratory alone in not truth, but persuasion. The best rules to form a young man, are, to talk little, to hear much, to reflect alone upon what has passed in company, to distrust one\\'s own opinions, and value others that deserve it. Science is analytical, descriptive, informative. Man does not live by bread alone, but by science he attempts to do so. Hence the deadliness of all that is purely scientific.

Rise up and live it.;Terry Goodkind;alone 1759;By far the greatest part of those goods which are the objects of desire, are procured \\x0cby labour and they may be multiplied, not in one country alone, but in many, almost without any assignable limit, if we are disposed to bestow the labour necessary to obtain them.;David Ricardo;alone 1760;Trust him not with your secrets, who, when left alone in your room, turns over your papers.;Johann Kaspar Lavater;alone 1761;You may tell a man thou art a fiend, but not your nose wants blowing to him alone who can bear a thing of that kind, you may tell all.;Johann Kaspar Lavater;alone 1762;Between 1910 and 1950 approximately 350 lives of Jesus were published in the English language alone.;John Clayton;alone 1763;You watch a hockey game, and the hand-eye coordination and the speed is really miraculous how those guys track the puck alone, just following it with their eyes.;Liev Schreiber;alone 1764;I never wanted to go on stage alone because if you mess up, who can you blame?;Patti LaBelle;alone 1765;I don\\'t know much about only children.

Until then, I was just scraping by.;Edie Falco;alone 1771;Eagles commonly fly alone. They are crows, daws, and starlings that flock together.;John Webster;alone 1772;I like being alone and I think this movie, as much as it is an investigation of connection and people bonding, I also think it\\'s just as much about loneliness.;Jason Schwartzman;alone 1773;I am very averse to bringing myself forward in print, but as my account will only appear as an appendage \\x0cto a former production, and as it will be confined to such topics as have connection with my authorship alone, I can hardly accuse myself of a personal intrusion.;Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley;alone 1774;The secret to being a writer is that you have to write. It\\'s not enough to think about writing or to study literature or plan a future life as an author. You really have to lock yourself away, alone, and get to work.;Augusten Burroughs;alone 1775;When I was old enough to go to movies alone, I got to see \\'Frankenstein\\' and \\'Dracula\\' on the big screen. I just fell in love with them.;George A. Romero;alone 1776;Autobiography begins with a sense of being alone.

He\\'s the center of a team - doctors, scientists, coaches, agents and so on.;Emil Zatopek;alone 1780;I don\\'t treat the band like I\\'m above them or that they\\'re a hired hand for me. We\\'ve never worked that way. So I\\'m a team player. I would be very uncomfortable having to do this alone.;Tom Petty;alone 1781;It is said that man doesn\\'t live by bread alone.

There\\'s no sound check, no back up. I stay with the hosts I am in a family home and it\\'s really nourishing.

It\\'s odd and wonderful.;Jane \\x0cSiberry;alone 1784;I hope this will help new moms not feel alone or desperate, and that there is no shame in their feelings. PPD is out of their control, but the treatment and healing process is not.;Brooke Shields;alone 1785;It\\'s good that the first half of the speech emphasized freedom, because George W.

He fears being alone, without allies.;Meir Kahane;alone 1797;I think that in itself is kind of an amazing achievement to be able to say that your full-time career is in any creative arts, let alone a show that has kept people interested for coming on four seasons and hopefully more.;Anna Paquin;alone 1798;In today\\'s interdependent world, a threat to one becomes a menace to all. And no state can defeat these challenges and threats alone.;Michelle Bachelet;alone 1799;Artists walk alone.;Ezra Miller;alone 1800;Christmas lights may be the loneliest thing for me, especially if you mix them up with reindeers and sleighs. I feel alone. I feel isolated. I feel I do not belong.;Mira Nair;alone 1801;In my cranky old age, I actually prefer recording alone now, on \\'The Simpsons,\\' for example, because I find that the director can just focus on what I\\'m doing and I can do a lot of variations.

Very alone.;Yves Saint Laurent;alone 1803;It felt like the first thing, but when I first started out, I got a job adapting a book by Russell Banks called \\'Rule Of The Bone.\\' I didn\\'t do a very good job.

Without them, you\\'re essentially standing alone, singing to yourself.;K. D. Lang;alone 1814;She goes through the vale of death alone, each time a babe is born.

Ellis;alone 1826;As the only girl growing up among three brothers, I was always afraid of being excluded.

It\\'s precisely like a kiss - you can\\'t do it alone.;John Cheever;alone 1832;Glasgow\\'s not a media center. When you\\'re there, when you\\'re hanging about, you feel quite detached from musical movements or fashions or anything like that. You do feel quite alone, in a good way.;Alex Kapranos;alone 1833;I believe in capitalism for everybody, not necessarily high finance but capitalism that works for the working men and women of this country who are out there paddling alone in America right now.;Rick Santorum;alone 1834;But there\\'s not enough time in life to go sit at a party, have a drink, and make idle conversation.

They serve as a good balance for each other.;Idina Menzel;alone 1839;I mean Buckingham Palace has never hired a professional public relations outfit let alone a Madison Avenue type and they would throw up their hands in horror at the very idea.;Anthony Holden;alone 1840;Mr. Churchill is proud of Britain\\'s stand alone, after France had fallen and before America entered the War.;Eamon de Valera;alone 1841;I\\'m actually not an exhibitionist at all.

You hide behind your music and let your emotions come out through the music.;Tim McGraw;alone 1842;I love nicknames. It makes me feel loved. It makes me feel less alone in this world.;Ellen Page;alone 1843;But there is a discomfort that surrounds grief. It makes even the most well-intentioned people unsure of what to say. And so many of the freshly bereaved end up feeling even more alone.;Meghan O\\'Rourke;alone 1844;Despite the demands of this job, one of the things my wife and I try to do is to spend time together alone. And one of the things we really enjoy doing together is seeing a good movie.;Warren Christopher;alone 1845;I have Graham Greene\\'s telephone number, but I wouldn\\'t dream of using it. I \\x0cdon\\'t seek out writers because we all want to be alone.;Patricia Highsmith;alone 1846;We are the only class in history that has been left to fight its battles alone, unaided by the ruling powers.

But my mom and I get alone really well - obviously, because my mom and my dad get along so well.;Jenna Bush;alone 1848;As I\\'ve gotten older I\\'ve occasionally found myself nostalgic for earlier periods of solitude, though I realize that\\'s also likely a false nostalgia, as I know there was nothing I wanted more during those periods than to not be alone, whatever that means.;Chris Ware;alone 1849;He alone loves the Creator perfectly who manifests a pure love for his neighbor.;Venerable Bede;alone 1850;For every five well- adjusted and smoothly functioning Americans, there are two who never had the chance to discover themselves.

Therefore \\x0cchemistry alone will not explain life\\'s origin, any more than a study of silicon, copper and plastic will explain how a computer can execute a program.;Paul Davies;alone 1857;Perhaps the best motivation for going to Mars is political. It is obvious that no single nation currently has either the will or the resources to do it alone, but a consortium of nations and space agencies could achieve it within 20 years.;Paul Davies;alone 1858;Should we find a second form of life right here on our doorstep, we could be confident that life is a truly cosmic phenomenon. If so, there may well be sentient beings somewhere in the galaxy wondering, as do we, if they are not alone in the universe.;Paul Davies;alone 1859;One thing, however, is sure, - that in all cases the effort should be to impose all the cost of repairing the wrong upon the doer of the wrong. This alone is real justice, and of course such justice is necessarily free.;Benjamin Tucker;alone 1860;Sisters are always drying their hair. Locked into rooms, alone, they pose at the mirror, shoulders bare, trying this way and that their hair, or fly importunate down the stair to answer the telephone.;Phyllis McGinley;alone 1861;We\\'ll try to include Iraqi officers in our staffs. We will do everything we can to empower Iraqi security forces to stand up on their own and operate where they can alone.;John Abizaid;alone 1862;I would as soon put a girl alone into a closet to meditate as give her only the society of her needle.;Maria Mitchell;alone 1863;Fear is that thing that keeps you up there on that other plateau. Fear is that thing that just keeps you closed down, and quite frankly, alone.;Andrew Shue;alone 1864;The White House alone cannot hold its opponents accountable.;Paul Weyrich;alone 1865;Largely this is a class thing - writers tend to be cosseted little middle-class kiddies who think that the world owes them a royalty cheque. But just doing it - being in your room for years on end, locked in your head, alone with invented ghosts - it weakens and softens the body. And I know I can\\'t just \\x0clive in my head.;Tony Parsons;alone 1866;However, democracy cannot be defined as the existence of parliaments and elections alone.;Recep Tayyip Erdogan;alone 1867;But Socialism, alone, can bring self-determination of their peoples.;Karl Liebknecht;alone 1868;By being friends with all, we are not alone.;Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa;alone 1869;No man is an island.

I think Jersey stands alone, and because I\\'m from Jersey, I never make fun of where people are from. I\\'ll make fun of what they look like, but I\\'ll never make fun of where they are from. Jersey is special. I\\'m vulnerable to criticism. Any artist is, because you work alone in your studio and, until recently, critics were the only way you\\'d get any feedback. I have tried to be a leader. I have tried in my role of being one of the first women at Google, let alone the first woman to have a baby, to really try to set the tone that this is a great place to work for diversity reasons. To really be centered and to really work well and to think about the kinds of things that I need to think about, I need to spend large amounts of time alone. Why has not anyone seen that fossils alone gave birth to a theory about the formation of the earth, that without them, no one would have ever dreamed that there were successive epochs in the formation of the globe. I have always been very obsessed with time. Time\\'s passage makes us all very vulnerable and because we all experience it in our own way, it can make us feel very alone. \\x0cHuman beings do not live in the objective world alone, nor alone in the world of social activity as ordinarily understood, but are very much at the mercy of the particular language which has become the medium of expression for their society. I very much wished not to be noticed, and to be left alone, and I sort of succeeded. After I lost my fiance, it seemed like it would be better to always be alone than to risk being hurt again. We enter the world alone, we leave the world alone. I have a grim outlook on the world, and in particular on humanity. Spent years denying it, but I am very misanthropic. And I live alone on a mountain for a reason. There is no one looking out for us. We are all alone. Judaism is much more communal, and partly as a consequence of my religious switch, I am increasingly more suspicous of my previous view that what people do in the privacy of their own home is their business alone. I\\'m throwing myself back in because I like being married. I don\\'t want to end this whole fabulous journey alone. I want someone by my side who I love and who loves me. I\\'ve finally found somebody who\\'s up to the task of being my wife, because I\\'m very high maintenance. Having gone through so many of the personal things I\\'ve gone through, its about creating an (online) space for girls to be heard. I don\\'t profess to have all the answers. But Ask Elizabeth is a space where girls are not alone. The private interest of the individual would not be sufficiently provided for by reasonable and cool self-love alone therefore the appetites and passions are placed within as a guard and further security, without which it would not be taken due care of. Men are beginning to realize that they are not individuals but persons in society, that man alone is weak and adrift, that he must seek strength in common action. As much as I long for a sort of security and consistency sometimes, I do enjoy sort of being busted around. I really don\\'t know what\\'s happening sometimes next week, let alone this year. \\x0cFor a while I felt very alone sort of out there in the world of comics, especially here in the States. The U.S. cannot go it alone simply when it is convenient. I would rather be alone and a loud voice for action than be silent. But, if you observe children learning in their first few years of life, you can see that they can and do learn on their own - we leave them alone to crawl, walk, talk, and gain control over their bodies. It happens without much help from parents. She can\\'t even chew gum and walk in a straight line, let alone write a book. That song is a story that shows how easily you could get slipped into being labeled as the bad guy, even though what you really trying to do is tell the bad guy to leave you alone. No matter how fast I could do it with the digital camera I don\\'t think I would get the same thing out of it. The passion I have for formulating an idea stands alone. It is the important essence of what I do. Taste is the fundamental quality which sums up all the other qualities. It is the nec plus ultra of the intelligence. Through this alone is genius the supreme health and balance of all the faculties. I think we need one recognized, respected public figure to make a tough, blunt statement on just what Reagan\\'s record is and what he might do to the country, let alone the Republican Party before Christmas. There is nothing like being left alone again, to walk peacefully with oneself in the woods. To boil one\\'s coffee and fill one\\'s pipe, and to think idly and slowly as one does it. Hungary is, in a word, in a state of WAR against the Hapsburg dynasty, a war of legitimate defence, by which alone it can ever regain independence and freedom. The power that is supported by force alone will have cause often to tremble. Highly educated young people are tutored, taught and monitored in all aspects of their lives, except the most important, which is character building. When it comes to this, most universities leave them alone. \\x0cThe Holy Spirit alone can do this, the Holy Spirit alone can establish this link with one\\'s neighbor. When I was working on Eye of the Beholder, I played a character who is so aloof that my whole lifestyle became very aloof. If someone knocked on my door, there was a part of me that went into a rage, because I wanted to be isolated and alone. I have a responsibility to nurture and shepherd my talent and when I\\'m living the parts of my life not related to that I feel I have the right to be left alone. Both my husband and I give a lot of ourselves in what we do because that is our public lives but in my private life, I have an intrinsic right to be left alone. President Johnson did not want the Vietnam War to broaden. He wanted the North Vietnamese to leave their brothers in the South alone. In the last 5 years, American employers have lost over $150 billion of productivity to depression alone. That is more than the GDP of 28 different States during the same period. The writing is really hard. You\\'re alone. It really pulls it out of you. You pull it out of your head. But when you\\'re a director, you\\'re shopping - you\\'re picking this actor, you\\'re picking this scene. It\\'s like the most intense kinetic high-speed shopping of all time. You sit in a chair and it will all come rushing at you like a wind tunnel. Looking back on those games, I probably hustled out of position as much as I hustled into position since I really never had any real training. I was working on instincts alone. There\\'s this thing of you can live in a city and be completely alone, not notice anything going on around you. There are actually quite high profile British TV star cameos in it that you probably wouldn\\'t even notice, that the British wouldn\\'t even notice, let alone the American audience. Scholarship was one thing, drudgery another. I very soon concluded that nothing would induce me to read, let alone make notes on, hundreds and hundreds of very, very, very boring books. \\x0cIn our open society, we are inclined to give to the less fortunate for the pure goodness of giving. We open our home to those who are alone on this holiday to spread some warmth into the life of another. I used to wonder if it was God\\'s plan that I should be alone for so much of my life. But I found peace. I found happiness within people and the world. Remember, the burden of sorrow is doubled when it is borne alone. I don\\'t like to produce albums. I hate producing albums, as a matter of fact, because I\\'m an obsessed mixer and I can\\'t leave it alone. You watch an old \\'Jeopardy!\\' and the categories alone are very plain. \\'Poetry,\\' or \\'Movies,\\' or \\'Physics.\\' If you watch it now, though, there\\'ll be a theme board where the categories are all Hitchcock movies. Lots more jokes, lots more high-concept categories and questions. He never is alone that is accompanied with noble thoughts. Acquire the habit of speaking to God as if you were alone with Him, familiarly and with confidence and love, as to the dearest and most loving of friends. We are ultimately alone in that we are ultimately responsible for ourselves. Iran has long sponsored terrorists who carry out homicide bombings in Israeli cities. However, it is a mistake to believe the danger Iran poses is directed at Israel alone. On the one hand, shopping is dependable: You can do it alone, if you lose your heart to something that is wrong for you, you can return it it\\'s instant gratification and yet something you buy may well last for years. That is, we believed, the supreme duty of the parent, who only was permitted to claim in some degree the priestly office and function, since it is his creative and protecting power which alone approaches the solemn function of Deity. Israel is no longer a people that dwells alone, and has to join the global journey toward peace, reconciliation and international cooperation. \\x0cI had never walked on the street alone when I was growing up in Calcutta, up to age 20. I had never handled money. You know, there was always a couple of bodyguards behind me, who took care if I wanted... I needed pencils for school, I needed a notebook, they were the ones who were taking out the money. I was constantly guarded. It can be kind of gruesome at times, making things alone. It\\'s necessary to start most work alone. But I\\'m tickled to death when I can pull somebody in or join someone, whether it\\'s borrowing poetry or traveling with an associate. I don\\'t understand the Democrats\\' approach to Social Security in this country, and I\\'m not alone. And I don\\'t have any specific steps to take because I don\\'t start the same way every time. But there is a knowing when it\\'s enough and you can leave it alone. I love photo sessions. I\\'m alone, I\\'m the queen, everyone\\'s taking care of me. The whole kiss-and-tell thing is a negative approach that often happens in a World Cup. We will see negative stories about the players and it can affect their confidence and the overall performance of the national team on the pitch, let alone the bid to actually stage the competition. What We want is to make it possible for our unfortunate people to live a life of industry for it is by steady work alone that we hope for our physical and moral rehabilitation. For this reason above all we have undertaken to rally our people around our ideal. And you know when I was growing up, I knew I wanted to have kids, but I knew I didn\\'t want to do it alone. Then once I was 41, 42, I had to accept that I probably wouldn\\'t have kids unless I decided to adopt later on, but even then it would be with a partner. If there\\'s ever an example that military power alone cannot be successful in Afghanistan, I think it was the Soviet experience. It is very frightening to feel alone when you are standing against a rich and powerful person and all his attendant helpers. \\x0cI think the Mother is gradually revealing itself to me and taking over. But it is not the Mother alone. It is the Mother and the Father, the male and the female, sort of gradually having their marriage. When anything goes digital, let alone something as immaterial as a book, there is a tendency to see it as just in the air to be taken, and to lose the sense that somebody once made it. There\\'s a sense of aliveness that comes from connection, shared experience. And you see it in every place. You see it when ball players jump up and down, gather at home plate, hugging, and it\\'s not just because they\\'re winning, it\\'s that shared moment, that feeling of - we enter the world alone, we leave alone. Traditionally, Medicare\\'s assurance has been that for the elderly and persons with disabilities that they will not be alone when confronted with the full burden of their health care costs. Myspace alone has just over 80 million users and ranks as the sixth most popular English language website and the eighth most popular site in the world. I never thought a basketball shoe would be named after a woman, let alone me. Always the aim for me is making people feel like they are not alone. That\\'s just the greatest feeling. Man, I hate to get depressing on you, but I don\\'t have a game. I\\'m so alone, so depressed, so dark, no. Strength alone knows conflict, weakness is born vanquished. If you think spreading money around by force seems like an odd definition of fairness, you\\'re not alone. When you see a struggle that you may be having personally put on a big screen and in a roomful of people, then it makes you feel less crazy or alone, because you\\'re seeing that other people are dealing with it too. You get to see in this imaginary scenario how people might try and answer some questions or deal with some problems. It is my personality alone that has brought back the waltz and made it a global craze. I have always had a sense that we are all pretty much alone in life, particularly in adolescence. \\x0cFor people who are really talented, what you don\\'t say becomes extremely important. You have to judge what to say and what to leave alone so you can let the talent develop. Time and space - time to be alone, space to move about - these may well become the great scarcities of tomorrow. We are never the same with others as when we are alone. We are different, even when we are in the dark with them. You ask me if I will not be glad when the last battle is fought, so far as the country is concerned I, of course, must wish for peace, and will be glad when the war is ended, but if I answer for myself alone, I must say that I shall regret to see the war end. The population forecast for the United States in 1970 is 170 million. The population forecast for Russia alone in 1970 is 251 million. The implications are clear. I do read books. I suppose it\\'s more or less the same thing, but at least I\\'m alone and I\\'m an individual. I can stop anytime I want, which I frequently do. I\\'ve always been shocked and waiting-for-the-other-shoe-to- drop that a girl would ever talk to me, let alone want to marry me. They always seem to hold the power to me, and from my mother to my wife to my daughter, every time I try to really figure them out, and think I\\'ve got them pegged, I pay for it. I talked about the barriers created by monopolies. I said that it was the role of government to break up these monopolies and that we couldn\\'t do it alone. Most photographers work best alone, myself included. It proved easier to buy the farm to get the mineral rights than to buy the coal rights alone. No matter how close to yours another\\'s steps have grown, in the end there is one dance you\\'ll do alone. Absolute truth belongs to Thee alone. Research and development needs permanent tax credits to build the technology that spurs our growth. But no government programs alone can get America\\'s students to study more science and math parents must push and help their children to meet this goal. \\x0cThe next thing I wrote was in a writing class at night school. It was about a poor woman who worked at a dime store and who was all alone for Christmas in Laurel, Mississippi. My brother and Lauren are very close with me and they are in Sun Valley, so sometimes I need to go there and feel their presence. And there are times I need to see my bro\\' alone. What\\'s important is promising something to the people, not actually keeping those promises. The people have always lived on hope alone. For a while I couldn\\'t leave the house by myself. Even if I was just grocery shopping alone, I\\'d get self-conscious. Words alone cannot fully convey the realities of the soul or the greatness of the human spirit. Let there be no mistake. A gay man alone could never begin to replicate the inner workings of the female mind. The great increase of our population throughout the Union will alone produce an important effect, and in no quarter will it be so sensibly felt as in those in contemplation. Alone is a much better film than House of the Dead and better than most horror movies out today. I think Alone in the Dark was too much an action creature movie than a horror creature movie. When I\\'m online, I\\'m alone in a room, tapping on a keyboard, staring at a cathode-ray tube. I like to have a massage therapist come to my house, get a massage, take a bath, go to bed. That\\'s a perfect night alone for me. I\\'m fortunate that I\\'ve been in this business long enough that I\\'ve earned the right to be left alone by my record company. We are very anxious to bring the Jews of Morocco over and we are doing all we can to achieve this. But we cannot count on the Jews of Morocco alone to build the country, because they have not been educated for this. When I work alone, it can be like dabbling with a canvas. Maybe you paint over bits, and it starts to form its own life and lead you off in a direction. It becomes an intuitive, subconscious process. \\x0cWhen I work alone, my process is like painting. With Fleetwood Mac, it\\'s more like movie making. Success doesn\\'t necessarily come from breakthrough innovation but from flawless execution. A great strategy alone won\\'t win a game or a battle the win comes from basic blocking and tackling. Some people can sometimes really invade your space and kind of never leave you alone. Now that I have found someone, I\\'m feeling more alone... than I ever have before. Thus, the poet\\'s word is beginning to strike forcefully upon the hearts of all men, while absolute men of letters think that they alone live in the real world. If I lived alone, Mom\\'d never sleep because she wouldn\\'t know I was okay. I didn\\'t need clothes. I was allowed the opportunity to act out moments you don\\'t get the opportunity to experience in your own life, let alone as a character in a film. I didn\\'t feel naked. Say not that honor is the child of boldness, nor believe thou that the hazard of life alone can pay the price of it: it is not to the action that it is due, but to the manner of performing it. Some of us may just, in one- on-one conversations with our family, with our friends, over the back fence with our neighbors, talk about the reality of our lives and realize that we\\'re not alone, that we have a right to be physically safe and emotionally safe in our own homes. Hiking is the best workout!... You can hike for three hours and not even realize you\\'re working out. And, hiking alone lets me have some time to myself. I can barely remember what I wrote yesterday, let alone 10 years ago. I can support going in after Saddam Hussein, but I want to make sure I don\\'t go alone. I spend my life essentially alone at a computer. That doesn\\'t change. I have the same challenges every day. Something about Texas I\\'m not proud of is that our state murdered 37 people last year alone. For each one of us stands alone in the midst of a universe. \\x0cI have two ideas for novels at the moment, neither of them all that conventional, but I\\'m not ready to choose between them yet, let alone settle down to the process of writing. You are forever alone. I think the idea that you can go this alone is - was a huge mistake. And unfortunately, there was a price paid in terms of suffering and pain for people in New Orleans. Your thoughts and emotions are yours alone. But the wicked passions of men\\'s hearts alone seem strong enough to leave pictures that persist the good are ever too luke-warm. Sometimes I think my husband is so amazing that I don\\'t know why he\\'s with me. I don\\'t know whether I\\'m good enough. But if I make him happy, then I\\'m everything I want to be. If you tell people where to go, but not how to get there, you\\'ll be amazed at the results. It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit. If you set goals and go after them with all the determination you can muster, your gifts will take you places that will amaze you. Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and you\\'re kind, amazing things will happen. It\\'s amazing the clarity that comes with psychotic jealousy. There are amazingly wonderful people in all walks of life some familiar to us and others not. Stretch yourself and really get to know people. People are in many ways one of our greatest treasures. I feel like I have had the most amazing life in my public service. When you have confidence, you can have a lot of fun. And when you have fun, you can do amazing things. The thing that is really hard, and really amazing, is giving up on being perfect and beginning the work of becoming yourself. If there was an observer on Mars, they would probably be amazed that we have survived this long. I am indeed amazed when I consider how weak my mind is and how prone to error. People are generally amazed that I would take an interest in any form that would require me to stop talking for three hours. \\x0cWith love, you should go ahead and take the risk of getting hurt because love is an amazing feeling. If you dream of something worth doing and then simply go to work on it and don\\'t think anything of personalities, or emotional conflicts, or of money, or of family distractions it is amazing how quickly you get through those 5,000 steps. You will never cease to be the most amazed person on earth at what God has done for you on the inside. When the shriveled skin of the ordinary is stuffed out with meaning, it satisfies the senses amazingly. People never cease to amaze me. The amazing fact is that America is founded on a document. It\\'s a work in progress. It can be tested by each generation. It\\'s amazing what ordinary people can do if they set out without preconceived notions. People must feel that the natural world is important and valuable and beautiful and wonderful and an amazement and a pleasure. Write in recollection and amazement for yourself. When it\\'s over, I want to say: all my life I was a bride married to amazement. I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms. It\\'s amazing how, over time, a person\\'s perspective can be altered. I\\'m proud of the U.S.A. We\\'ve done some amazing things. To wear our flag in the Olympics is an honor. The body is an amazing machine... If you eat the right things your body will perform incredibly well! I really love the internet. They say chat-rooms are the trailer park of the internet but I find it amazing. As a kid, I kind of spent my life being amazed by being tricked. I love being tricked. I still love it today. It\\'s amazing, if you know what you want to say, how fast it is to write. I\\'m always amazed at anyone\\'s interest in what I have to say. It was amazing to me that, all of a sudden, I was hearing my music on the radio and coming out of cars. When the youth of America gets together, amazing things happen. Nothing amazes me anymore. \\x0cWords to me were magic. You could say a word and it could conjure up all kinds of images or feelings or a chilly sensation or whatever. It was amazing to me that words had this power. It\\'s an amazing luxury to say I\\'m 31 years old and I\\'m gonna take a year off. That\\'s pretty amazing. Isn\\'t it amazing the way the future succeeds in creating an appropriate past? It\\'s amazing how much trouble you can get in when you don\\'t have anything else to do. I like pens. My writing is so amazing there\\'s never a need to erase. I am constantly amazed by Tina Fey. And I am Tina Fey. I was always amazed about how much I could finally squeeze into a thirty second commercial. I\\'ve had to calm down, I have a kid! It is amazing. It\\'s the best thing ever. Nothing better than it. Amazingly when you add life and consciousness to the equation you can actually explain some of the biggest puzzles of science.  Amazement awaits us at every corner. There are a lot of people with a lot of money, and I\\'m amazed they don\\'t understand what a great pleasure it can be to give. The body can do amazing things in a situation when it is really called for. I have a ridiculous fear of sharks but I\\'d jump in the water in a second for an amazing role. You would be amazed what the ordinary guy knows. More and more couples are having this negotiation or discussion, but I\\'m still amazed at the number who aren\\'t and where the cultural norm sort of kicks in and they just assume that mom\\'s got to be the one who stays home, not dad. In 29 years, I had recorded over 2,200 songs. I was amazed. It\\'s amazing to me that young people will still pick up a cigarette. The truth sets you free. It\\'s a very liberating thing, when you say this is who I am warts and all and then you can just get on with life. It\\'s amazing. But I am not going to live for ever. And the more I know it, the more amazed I am by being here at all. \\x0cIt\\'s the most amazing feeling to hold your child in your arms. To me, when a great band is playing together, it\\'s amazing for me. I had a friend whose family had dinner together. The mother would tuck you in at night and make breakfast in the morning. They even had a spare bike for a friend. It just seemed so amazing to me. It\\'s amazing how a competitive nature can turn a negative into something positive. To feel the presence of the Lord is an amazing thing. It\\'s amazing how, age after age, in country after country, and in all languages, Shakespeare emerges as incomparable. It\\'s been amazing, the number of commercials that I\\'ve done, starting back in 1968. It must be 8,000. I thank you God for this most amazing day, for the leaping greenly spirits of trees, and for the blue dream of sky and for everything which is natural, which is infinite, which is yes.  It is amazing that people who think we cannot afford to pay for doctors, hospitals, and medication somehow think that we can afford to pay for doctors, hospitals, medication and a government bureaucracy to administer it. France, and the whole of Europe have a great culture and an amazing history. Most important thing though is that people there know how to live! In America they\\'ve forgotten all about it. I\\'m afraid that the American culture is a disaster. It\\'s amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper. We want to reinvent the phone. What\\'s the killer app? The killer app is making calls! It\\'s amazing how hard it is to make calls on most phones. We want to let you use contacts like never before - sync your iPhone with your PC or mac. Tell me, why is the media here so negative? Why are we in India so embarrassed to recognise our own strengths, our achievements? We are such a great nation. We have so many amazing success stories but we refuse to acknowledge them. Why? \\x0cMay your trails be crooked, winding, lonesome, dangerous, leading to the most amazing view. May your mountains rise into and above the clouds. Why is Cloud 9 so amazing? What is wrong with Cloud 8? That joke came off the top of my head, and the top of my head ain\\'t funny! It is amazing how complete is the delusion that beauty is goodness. It\\'s amazing how people will give when you don\\'\" I still think that movies are amazing I respect actors and directors. I loved hip-hop. The first stuff I heard was Public Enemy, and I couldn\\'t believe it. It was amazing, and I\\'ve always loved hip-hop. It\\'s an amazing feeling to go into a studio and really be alone. I\\'ve got some incredible fans actually - so loyal and they make me birthday cards and Christmas cards. I got this package of poems and artwork based around the songs. They\\'ve got this thing called \\'Floetry\\' where they all have to put in artwork. They\\'ve set up their own competitions and stuff which is kind of amazing. I saw \\'The Artist.\\' It\\'s really beautiful and it\\'s all done to the letter with all the silent film techniques. The costumes were amazing and the dog is so good.  My siblings and I were friends with the boys who would become our stepbrothers - we grew up on the same street. I feel very special to have these amazing people in my life and if we hadn\\'t all moved into this big house together I think I would have missed out on that, because we would have drifted apart. Singing really is acting. In a lot of ways, it\\'s much more personal. I love music, and being able to work on that is amazing. If I can inspire people by showing that following a dream by working hard and being determined is possible, it\\'s amazing. I love a beautiful gown on stage, and luckily I\\'ve been fortunate to wear some amazing dresses. I get such lovely gifts from fans... amazing pictures, handmade jewellery. I\\'m very lucky! \\x0cI believe I could have had a career in the music industry without \\'X Factor,\\' but it was an amazing platform that propelled me to where I am now. It\\'s been a fascinating thing because we didn\\'t really know how to write when we started South Park at all. It\\'s been like, we\\'ve just sort of grown up a bit and it\\'s amazing to just see how, if you take Butters and Cartman and put them in any scene, it works. Sally Field looks amazing in general, never mind her age! She\\'s a phenomenally talented actress and has had a career spanning so many decades. I started running outside when I was at \\'Biggest Loser.\\' Then I got runner\\'s knee, and thought I was never going to be able to shake it. When I overcame that and ran the L.A. Marathon, it was such an amazing thing, and now running is such a part of my routine. We watch a lot of Discovery Channel, shows like \\'The Biggest Loser\\' and even \\'Amazing Race.\\' You learn a lot about the world, it\\'s fun and nobody\\'s interested in beating anybody down. And then the opposite: I\\'m a huge fan of \\'Survivor.\\' Spinning has been such an amazing part of my exercise. I love the music, the energy, and the sweat. It\\'s a tough class, which makes me feel like I\\'ve really accomplished something. It\\'s a great way to burn fat and lean out the body. An all-around win!  If you think you don\\'t want to play another psychopath, but the script is amazing, and the director is fantastic, and the story is incredible, then you may end up playing your third psychopath in a row. Truthfully, being pregnant is changing me as a person. Each day is part of this amazing journey that has completely shifted the focus of my life and made me reevaluate my personal and professional goals. Strangely enough, when the Sugababes\\' \\'Freak Like Me\\' went to number 1, which was built around my \\'Are \\'Friends\\' Electric\\' song, I had another song called \\'Rip\\' go to number 1 in the Kerrang TV chart, so I was pulling new people in from very different areas of musical interest. That was quite an amazing week. \\x0cI\\'m a big fan of Mashable and TechCrunch and other outlets like that, but TechMeme obviously does an amazing job of aggregating. My daughter is in love with Adele. She listens to her every day. To see someone with that much passion and soul move a 9-year-old is amazing and it\\'s magical. I think having children is the most amazing thing. I put the costume on and said \\'It\\'s not very comfortable, but it looks amazing,\\' so it\\'s all good. My mother is the coolest, most amazing person I know. There are some amazing stories from all over this country, where people\\'s work and contribution has been acknowledged. To be part of that is an absolutely fantastic feeling. I decided to give acting a serious, committed try, and soon after, I read the script for \\'Lovely and Amazing.\\' The story was beautiful and honest, and the characters struggled with the same insecurities many women - including me - face. I didn\\'t think I had a chance in hell of being in the film, but I knew I had to go for it. I really would love to do a piece like Julia Roberts or Charlize Theron in \\'Erin Brockovich\\' or \\'North Country.\\' They were both so amazing and so inspiring. I would love to touch someone in the way their performances touched me. I\\'m an actor, so sometimes there are moments where I think about everything that\\'s happening and I want to cry. I\\'m doing what I love and I will be doing it for a very, very long time - and it\\'s amazing. A lot of people don\\'t get to do that. I have a full life: I have two amazing kids, I have great friends, great family. And right now, that\\'s plenty for me to manage. A new relationship just seems like way too much work. I\\'ve worked on films where the budgets are almost limitless and you\\'re in trailers that are bigger than a hotel room. You\\'re taken care of and the food is amazing, the quality of the job is amazing and then you work on smaller things but it never dictates my happiness or my willingness to go to work. \\x0cIt is amazing to think after all that has happened in this country in the last few years, the last few decades, that so many people have this blind faith that government is our friend and therefore, so we don\\'t need protections against it. Once the kids are in school, it\\'s amazing what you can do. The feeling of your baby taking nourishment from your body for the first time is amazing, and it remains the most touching moment of my life. Growing up in New York has influenced my style so much, and I have an amazing relationship with my stylist, Estee Stanley. We have so much fun with the whole process. She picks out dresses, I try things on and play dress up, and we get creative to see what works. Every now and then, I have blissful moments of thanking God for all the amazing things that are happening. When I leave the White House after just meeting Obama or when I see my face on the cover of \\'Rolling Stone\\' or when I meet someone who tells me that their daughter is inspired by me, those are moments that are incredibly joyful. I\\'m overjoyed and beyond honored to be a part of the L\\'Oreal Paris family. I\\'m such a fan of L\\'Oreal Paris not just for all of their amazing products, but for what they stand for. I got fitter when I did \\'Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.\\' I wore a loincloth - that\\'s a lot of motivation! Of course this is Vegas and it is the melting pot for all over the world, but people from all over the world know Donny and Marie. It is amazing. I have been in the business a long time to realize careers can be fleeting. Five years is a long career nowadays for some people, and here we are still going strong after 40 years. Working with amazing people, you continue to learn and develop yourself, as an actor and as a person. I never travel without my Stetson, but the more I wear it the more I realise that no one wears hats any more. When I was a kid everybody wore hats, especially in Texas, but I get off the plane in Dallas now and I\\'m the only guy with a hat. It\\'s amazing. \\x0cAs his partner on this amazing journey, I can tell you Mitt Romney was not handed success. He built it. And I thought, when I have kids, that\\'s the sort of well told, silly, and fun fairy tale that I would want to take them to. But it was an amazing experience. And I think Shrek is a real classic, a fairy tale classic. The overall physical demand that Iraq has is pretty amazing. It\\'s 130 degrees, and the soldiers are carrying about 100 pounds of extra gear. It\\'s a pretty rigorous schedule and routine for them. I work with all these amazing voice actors that do a kajillion voices. You have to wait for a big star to come in and generate interest on a project, and now that has become me, which is an amazing blessing. We are on the precipice of a crisis, a Constitutional crisis. The checks and balances, which have been at the core of this Republic, are about to be evaporated by the nuclear option. The checks and balances that say if you get 51% of the vote, you don\\'t get your way 100% of the time. It is amazing, it\\'s almost a temper tantrum. I mean, there are some amazing storytelling being done on the small screen right now. That\\'s what so cool about being in television right now. Studios, networks are starting to throw more resources, better writers, more production values... and to be part of that is awesome. I love vintage shopping, I think it\\'s really fun. And I love the feeling of finding the most amazing piece for less. It\\'s been such a deep and amazing journey for me, getting close to John Keats, and also I love Shelley and Byron. I mean, the thing about the Romantic poets is that they\\'ve got the epitaph of romantic posthumously. They all died really young, and Keats, the youngest of them all. In football you always get judged on your last game. Whoever you are, or how amazing you are, it\\'s the last game that everyone has seen. I just want to be a part of great stories, whether I\\'m part of an amazing ensemble cast or I\\'m leading it or the antagonist or whatever. \\x0cThe last real movie stars were probably Redford and Newman. And things were different then. There wasn\\'t this amazing amount of magazines and information about them. There are so many different people that I\\'ve emulated vocally. In the rock world - Sebastian Bach, Vince Neil, Freddie Mercury, Robert Plant. They all had amazing vocal talent. When I\\'m doing a film, I love getting together after work with my costars. But we get back to L.A. and I\\'m like, \\'I don\\'t want to go to a club with you, dude. I mean, I think you\\'re rad, and if you want to come play Scrabble with me, that\\'s amazing.\\' I saw Ellen and my knees were weak. It was amazing. And it was very hard for me to get her out of my mind after that. Then when I saw her that night, we started talking, and that\\'s that. Politically, Obama\\'s amazing streak of self-destructing opponents who have lain beneath his feet during his unlikely political career appears to be holding. I know some of my parents\\' friends think \\'Little Britain\\' is in incredibly poor taste. But swimming the Channel? You can\\'t really say anything negative about that, can you? There\\'s nothing better than making your parents happy. The glee on my father\\'s face that day was amazing. I run from Horatio Street down just past Battery Park City and back. It\\'s amazing to run and see the Statue of Liberty and the ferries coming in. People think if you\\'re not near Central Park, there\\'s nowhere to go, but there\\'s a whole ecosystem happening down here. I thought, after the Pulitzer, at least nothing will surprise me quite that much in my life. And another one happened. It was quite amazing. It\\'s amazing how coke encompasses everything in your life. Addicts cannot confront life because they only think of their next hit. I ruined life for my parents, my sister and all my friends. It\\'s kind of amazing how popular \\'Grey\\'s Anatomy\\' is. What other show can boast such an annoyingly sincere cast of doctors, sniveling through such perfunctory love triangles? \\x0cTwilight\\' is such an amazing project, and I think it opened up doors for all of us cast members.;Kellan Lutz;amazing 2293;I finish so many books it\\'s amazing. I\\'m also doing Rosetta Stone, learning some French.;Kellan Lutz;amazing 2294;I was blessed, because I come from a family where they knock you down before you float away. I have a lot of brothers who just make sure we have our feet on the ground, and my mom is a rock star. She is an amazing mother.;Kellan Lutz;amazing 2295;When we\\'re on set, we kind of joke around, and when we\\'re rehearsing, we change up the scenes and make each other laugh. We lighten up the mood. The blooper reel is going to be amazing on \\'New Moon. Motion capture is amazing. I prefer it. You wear a \\'Power Ranger\\'-esque suit, you have tape balls on you, you have 60 cameras around you capturing your every movement and there\\'s no hair, no makeup. For \\'Around the World in 80 Plates\\' we got to travel all over, having what was like a cross between a culinary competition and races. And in each country we had a chef Ambassador. We went to London, Barcelona, Bologna, Hong Kong, Thailand, Morocco... It was amazing. I go to Saint Barth in the French West Indies for two weeks each year. That place is amazing. Amazing people, beautiful beaches, great wine, wonderful harbors... It\\'s incredibly romantic. I was homeless for a little bit. I was on people\\'s couches, but it was an amazing journey. I got to make people laugh all the way. God bless you if you have one child, but I don\\'t think anybody should have just one child. Everybody needs a sibling. I have siblings, and I have so many amazing, precious memories with my siblings. I don\\'t know what I would do if I had been an only child. I got amazing training both with Theatre Sports... back in Edmonton, Alberta - I can\\'t give those people enough credit - and the daytime drama I did. Incredible training, both of them. My parents were kind of like me in that they had tons and tons of weird, amazing stuff. \\x0cI have a really amazing fan club, it\\'s contemporary but it\\'s a little bit old school. There\\'s a lot of connection. I have a fan club president who really responds to people. It\\'s amazing how much you can absorb on a film set. I just think we\\'re living in a time of massive, amazing change, like the Industrial Revolution on acid. Theatre, when it is at its best, takes a lot of beating - the live experience and the shared collective experience of live storytelling is really special when it is good. Particularly here in New York because the audiences are amazing, very vocal and very engaged, and that makes theatre very exciting. As a young black boy, it made me proud to see black leaders that did something amazing and made the world change. Well, Jeff Buckley for me is one of the greatest singers I\\'ve ever heard. And the reason why is he has an amazing range, amazing emotional power in his voice. And the music he put around it also just had this passion and this soul to it and this spirit to it that very few artists have, and he passed at a very young age. I love Louisiana. It\\'s amazing. I\\'d said to my sweetheart a couple of days before that the SAG and Spirit Award nomination was amazing and I had no attachment to the Academy Award. I knew I was an underdog so I just decided to sleep through the announcement. Do you like my suit? I think this is an amazing suit, don\\'t you think? Walmart is an amazing story of entrepreneurship and, as one of the world\\'s most powerful brands, touches millions of lives every day. I think what\\'s really amazing is that given the scale of the web and getting the compute power we have today, we\\'re starting to see things that appear intelligent but actually aren\\'t semantically intelligent. Linda Georgian is a wonderful psychic. She can do amazing things. The resilience of these people is amazing. I am a great believer that the sooner we get things up and running in terms of sport in this area, the better. \\x0cI walk into a kids\\' store, and it\\'s amazing, the types of instruments - little squeaky things, rattling things, spinning tops. The human body and mind are tremendous forces that are continually amazing scientists and society. Therefore, we have no choice but to keep an open mind as to what the human being can achieve. Going to a concert is so overwhelming and the energy is amazing. I look up to Mick Jagger because he\\'s an amazing performer and he\\'s such an individual. I respect him and admire him eternally. I have two younger sisters and I\\'m such an advocate of owning who you are as a person. Don\\'t be ashamed or intimidated. Never feel like you are not amazing. Whether it\\'s 18 years old or 40 years old, we think we know what\\'s going on. But if you\\'re lucky enough to continue the journey, its amazing how we keep learning how much we didn\\'t know. The business that people do in LA on the social level is amazing. You go to a restaurant, bump into this guy or that guy. The next day you get a call, and they want you in their movie. The current Babe Ruth of improv? Sacha Baron Cohen. He\\'s pretty amazing. It\\'s amazing how I can just ramble on for hours, isn\\'t it? And so unentertaining or uninteresting. But I can ramble on for hours. It\\'s a sort of terrible gift, isn\\'t it? If my kids are doing well, then my life is going pretty well. And if my kids aren\\'t doing well, it doesn\\'t matter how the other elements of my life are. It\\'s kind of amazing to have a context like that. This is really wonderful. My father is an amazing man. What makes America amazing is that there have always been men and women of courage who were willing to think more about the future of their children and grandchildren than they did about their own political careers. I\\'m one of those people that thinks the Internet is amazing, and I can\\'t believe it exists. \\x0cIt\\'s wonderful to be appreciated for being quirky, and to see Zooey Deschanel and the quirky, indie film types get mainstream play is amazing for women, because women are much more complicated than what we\\'ve see on TV in the past. I\\'ve done my best to work from a place of humility - always looking over your shoulder saying, \\'Does this suck?\\' and I think that\\'s a good way to work. The other way to work is where you start to think, \\'I\\'m on fire, I\\'m amazing!\\' and I don\\'t think that\\'s the way to work. I was terribly shy when I was growing up, I really wasn\\'t confident with other people and I think I was always afraid of up or not being this very cool, amazing person that I wanted to be. I just believe that the feeling of wonder is amazing. I am pushing myself as far as I can humanly push myself... I can only hope for the best and expect the worse. I\\'m tired of being around men all the time. I\\'m going to start a band called Skirt with three girls and I\\'ll play the guitar and sing backing vocals in drag. I went window shopping when I was in New York, saw a lot of amazing dresses. Partly because his life ended before the age of 50, Hamilton was defined by the other founding fathers, and he managed, with amazing consistency, to alienate most of them. So I won an Oscar. It\\'s amazing. I\\'ve got that for the rest of my life for a performance I am proud of. It nearly killed me. I am really proud of the film. That\\'s it, moving on. It\\'s a melting pot, southern Africa. You find these cultural collisions that result in art and music, and it\\'s pretty amazing. I have a wonderful husband. I have three amazing kids. My mom was amazing. She believed in me and we were best friends. When Maurice touched a keyboard, it was like something from a movie, magical. He would always give you something from a movie, and you\\'d go, what did you just play... immediately inspirational writings, amazing. That\\'s what we\\'re going to miss. \\x0cMy dad was working abroad, in Iraq, and he was a doctor. We used to go and visit him, in Baghdad, off and on. For the first ten years of my life, we used to go backwards and forwards to Baghdad, so that was quite amazing. I spent a lot of time traveling around the Middle East. Everything has combined to make my life in New York an amazing experience. I told my manager a few years ago that I wanted to move here and try acting in the theater. Most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored. We had more exploration ships down there during Captain Cook\\'s time than now. It\\'s amazing. I\\'ve also long since realized that the way to really engage children is to give out prizes it\\'s amazing how it concentrates their minds. When you\\'re a stay-at-home mother you have to pretend it\\'s really boring, but it\\'s not. It\\'s enriching and fulfilling, and an amazing experience. And then when you\\'re a working mother you have to pretend that you feel guilty all day long. My time at Honda was amazing. Some of my best times in Formula One, actually. I might not have won races, just one race, but I had a lot of fun. My \\'Movember\\' moustache was never going to be as big as Nigel Mansell\\'s, but I tried my best. The amazing thing is that when you try to grow a moustache, you notice everyone else\\'s. There are some amazing moustaches on the grid. To go to the Oscars for Moneyball - that was pretty amazing. And to be able to go work with Kathryn Bigelow - that\\'s going to be pretty sweet. Hopefully I don\\'t have to go back to being a waiter. That\\'s still my main goal. To go to the Oscars for \\'Moneyball\\' - that was pretty amazing. After I finished high school I went to Hong Kong and Thailand and spent some time there. Just to get that whole experience of being out of the bubble that I was in from high school in Vancouver, to be able to travel around and be on your own was an amazing experience. \\x0cI was dating my first boyfriend in high school for a long time, and we broke up before prom. I hadn\\'t met anyone else that I really wanted to go with, and my friends have always been amazing. So I went with my friends and got a million photos with them! With fitness, I do Bikrams hot yoga. The gym that I have in my building is amazing. I love to do cardio and weights there. You know, the reward for \\'Captain America\\' is amazing. It\\'s always fun to see a giant spectacle film and see the fun stuff - the special effects. The environmental benefits of hydrogen are also outstanding. When used as an energy source, hydrogen produces no emissions besides water. Zero polluting emissions, an amazing advance over the current sources of energy that we use. I\\'ll always be this crazy, fun person, but when it\\'s time to get married, I\\'m going to be an amazing wife. The difference between Marilyn Monroe and the early Pamela Anderson is not that great. What\\'s amazing is that the taste of American men and international tastes in terms of beauty have essentially stayed the same. Styles change, but our view of beauty stays the same. I\\'ve traveled all over the country for years speaking in churches, teaching the Ten Commandments. It\\'s amazing if 2 percent of any congregation knows the Ten Commandments. Shakespeare is all big themes, like the most amazing love, or the most scary war. Fatherhood is the most amazing thing that could ever have happened in my life. As a kid who wasn\\'t into sports, at school I felt almost alienated at times, whereas in the theatre community there was this amazing sense of camaraderie. Early on, we would go to rehearsals with my dad and I was like the mascot for the backstage crew. That was a big part of my childhood, so I dreamed of one day doing a play in London. \\x0cIt was said Daredevil grew up in Hell\\'s Kitchen, an amazing name for a neighbourhood. But that opened a Pandora\\'s box of all the crime stuff I wanted to do. I borrowed liberally from Will Eisner\\'s \\'The Spirit\\' and turned \\'Daredevil\\' into a crime comic. Comics are so full of amazing work. And I can\\'t look at a drawing of a woman without thinking of, for instance, Wallace Wood and his amazing way of capturing beauty. When you think of what Americans accomplished, building these amazing cities and all the good it\\'s done in the world, it\\'s kind of disheartening to hear so much hatred of America, not just from abroad, but internally. So when I go home, sometimes, even when I had an amazing game, I always think about what I missed. In America, Blackberry Farm in Tennessee is one of the most amazing hotels I\\'ve had the privilege of staying at. It\\'s better to get the nutrients for healthy skin from food, not supplements. Salmon, walnuts, blueberries, spinach... lots of my favorite foods happen to be amazing for skin too. I discovered something amazing, which has caused a lot of controversy - the fountain of youth. I have to keep it a secret! Surfing is such an amazing concept. You\\'re taking on Nature with a little stick and saying, \\'I\\'m gonna ride you!\\' And a lot of times Nature says, \\'No you\\'re not!\\' and crashes you to the bottom. When I look into the crowd, I see young and old, black and white - it\\'s amazing that I\\'m able to connect with so many different kinds of people. We are really on top of one another at the moment and I think it is amazing how we stay so close. Maybe that\\'s the test. Why not totally put yourself together, rather than always wonder whether you actually like each other? Considering the amount of information we\\'re bombarded by, it\\'s amazing if a song can transcend time. I love insects. They are amazing. \\x0cThere are very few dance companies in the world and you have to be phenomenal. You have to not be injured. You have to have a really strong mind to deal with the dance world. People who can do it are amazing to me. You cannot have a life outside of dance. Beyonce is the most amazing woman in the world. Well, when you\\'re the youngest of five, parents kind of lose interest more and more through the children. I think my eldest brother was under loads of pressure to do something amazing with his life, but by the time I came around they were like, \\'Well, let\\'s hope he doesn\\'t kill a guy.\\'  I really liked the helicopter pilot in \\'Dawn of the Dead\\', when he gets bitten and comes out of the elevator. That guy was amazing. He did this incredible walk that we didn\\'t even know about until we started shooting. First of all, plain and simple, you have no real idea of what it means to be famous until you become famous. It\\'s a double-edged sword. Obviously there are a lot of amazing things about fame, but there are also a lot of challenging things about it. Stevie Wonder is just one of those guys that completely delivers everything that you want to be true about Stevie Wonder. He\\'s an amazing human being, and the fairytale exists with that man. Nobody has it all, but for me to even come close is amazing. When you write biographies, whether it\\'s about Ben Franklin or Einstein, you discover something amazing: They are human. You get moments all the time that kind of make you pinch yourself, some of them make you quite emotional. Winning a BRIT was a big moment because we were just so excited to be at the awards in the first place. Selling out Madison Square Garden was pretty amazing too. Then we woke to the news that our UK tour was sold out. It was crazy. The attitude is we live and let live. This is actually an amazing change in values in a rather short time and it\\'s an example of freedom from religion. \\x0cYes, the companionship is amazing. You know, you can get that physical attraction that happens is great, but then there\\'s an awful lot of time and the rest of the day that you have to fill. On the surface, rock and roll changes at an amazing pace. The influence of a figure like the Maharishi can appear and disappear in a matter of months. Talk about old fashioned rock and roll finds itself dead before it begins. It\\'s amazing that for actors mostly, it\\'s a risk to attach yourself to a film that you don\\'t know whether or not it\\'s going to even be made and if you sign on, in doing so, who else is going to be in the movie with you. I hate the stereotype of the pitfalls of the child actor. There are so many amazing examples - Natalie Portman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jodie Foster, Drew Barrymore - of people who have made it through.  I think it\\'s an amazing quality to be able to roll with the punches and not be totally ruined as a person because life\\'s been rough for you. That\\'s a really admirable way to go through your life. Like most people my age, my job is the main focus of my life. I don\\'t have some kind of jet-setting fabulous lifestyle where I\\'m constantly in situations to acquire amazing anecdotes, that\\'s it. I think that in itself is kind of an amazing achievement to be able to say that your full- time career is in any creative arts, let alone a show that has kept people interested for coming on four seasons and hopefully more. I don\\'t like staying in hotels. I like to be in my own bed. San Diego as a city is really awesome. The only hard part of it for me is that I\\'m away from my family and my house. But as far as shooting down there, we get amazing locations, and the crew is really, really stellar down there. They are really fun. \\x0cI\\'d do pretty much anything to get back on stage. I\\'d like to develop a new musical. I nearly had a heart attack when I heard that they\\'re developing John Waters\\' Cry- Baby because that is so amazing and super and wonderful and I wish that I could be involved. But it\\'s not the right time and I understand that. But I hear things like that and I get that little tingle in my stomach. Me and my friend Ioan Gruffudd are like chalk and cheese when it comes to clothes. He lives for his clothes and has an amazing wardrobe. If we\\'re going out I\\'ll turn up at his house and say, \\'I haven\\'t got anything to wear,\\' and he\\'ll tut and sigh and then lend me something swanky. Everything that has happened to me has been amazing and surprising. And it is very sexy as well: somebody says I\\'m taking you on a surprise date, you don\\'t know where you are going and you can\\'t see and then you put your hand out and there is a tiger. Amazing. Housing Works is the coolest thrift store in the world, because not only are they the best thrift store - they\\'re not the most thrifty thrift store - but they have amazing stuff and all of their proceeds go directly to kids, mostly homeless kids, living with AIDS and HIV in New York, in the metropolitan area.  I seriously love to cook... My grandmother was an amazing cook. As a kid I used to help her make handmade pasta, Cavatelli and Ravioli. It was one of my favorite things to do. I love the idea of making whatever is in the fridge into something. I tend to not watch things that are current. And then if everybody swears it\\'s amazing then I\\'ll like watch the whole series in a weekend. I think it\\'s very empowering to be able to have a career and to be a mother. It gives you an amazing sense of self. What an amazing opportunity to do something like direct a movie and step out of your creative comfort zone and yet do something that is also so familiar at the same time. I was also just excited to have the chance to direct, which I may never get to do again. \\x0cThe magic kit we developed with Idea Village is an extraordinary success in 40,000 stores across America. The TV commercial we shot for it has produced amazing results - unbelievable. I had an amazing childhood, lots of love. But my dad worked his tail off, getting up at 4 in the morning and going off at 5, 6 o\\'clock, yet he always had time to spend with his kids and his wife. Magic is the oldest part of the show business profession. It can now be used as a forward-thinking tool to build a child\\'s confidence. It has been an amazing part in many entertainers\\' lives, including Steve Martin and the late Johnny Carson. I know that my grandfather is 92 years old. And he has seen this country evolve in amazing ways. He looks at South Carolina and he says, wow, what an amazing state that we have the blessing to live within because of the evolution. Well, what I love about \\'80s rock music is the amazing, fantastic melodies. You don\\'t have a lot of time you have to get it right. It\\'s amazing how they create these episodes in such a short amount of time. They lavish a lot of care and money on each episode, and they just look terrific. So it was good for me to play a likable person and it was just an amazing situation to be in. My public image is so low-key, but I get to travel the world and still have an audience and it\\'s really amazing. I don\\'t take that for granted. Being on \\'Glee\\' was amazing. I remember my first day on set, my first day I arrived to the set I was in my trailer and all of the actors came and banged on my door - Lea Michele, Chris Colfer, Amber Riley, Naya Rivera. They all welcomed me with open arms, so it was a great experience. It felt like family, and I miss them a lot over there. That\\'s an amazing moment, the first time you hear yourself on radio. It\\'s still thrilling. Recently I\\'ve been doing risottos. Some of them have been amazing. Some of them, not all of them. Alexander Gonzalez Inarritu is a great director. He\\'s the one I first worked with. He\\'s amazing. \\x0cI suppose it\\'s amazing when you think how many things people get involved in that don\\'t work. The amount of control you have over somebody if you can monitor internet activity is amazing. It\\'s amazing how quickly people on the internet can pick something up, but it\\'s also amazing how quickly they can drop it. Being a mother is the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me in my life. It\\'s amazing what sleep does for your looks. I started crying the other day just thinking that the baby is going to leave me soon! You have this relationship with this person in your belly and it\\'s really amazing. My favorite designer is Christian Lacroix, not just because his clothes are amazing and I love them, but because he\\'s so nice. When I did his fashion show, he was the first one to arrive there and he helped everyone. Well, I\\'d love to work with Kate Winslet - she\\'s amazing. It was amazing and inspiring to see so many people come together through music to aid the great state of Vermont. I\\'ve created, directed and choreographed for Lady Gaga since the beginning, so \\'Born This Way,\\' this was musically such an amazing evolution and such a brilliant record. So when she played it for me, it took me a while to find out the visual interpretation that I could give back to her. If you love dance and you have the gift of teaching, teaching is super amazing and important because my teachers planted that seed in me. As a teacher you understand the difference or the definition of a Baryshnikov or a Gregory Hines, so teaching is really important and very necessary. Choreography is amazing. I\\'m still a dancer, yet I transitioned into choreography then as a Creative Director. All of these creative elements are brought out of being a dancer. Directing is something that comes out of understanding movement and choreography. Directing movement is directing a dance piece. The Dance Scene\\' is basically the most amazing dance show in the world, and it follows me as a creative director. You see how I maintain that creativity.;Laurieann \\x0cGibson;amazing 2424;I think dance is amazing because what people don\\'t realize is like when you dance your spirit and your soul get ignited. You\\'re not only releasing endorphins, but also your spirit is awakening. It makes you feel good and happy.;Laurieann Gibson;amazing 2425;Pilates is amazing, my posture is so much better and I\\'m even starting to get muscles on my tummy - it\\'s incredible.;Kelly Osbourne;amazing 2426;I enjoyed being a teammate of Deion Sanders. He brings different elements to the game that many people would not even realize, and to watch and witness a superior talent like him and watch him prepare and train, and study the game is truly amazing.;Emmitt Smith;amazing 2427;Birdie is amazing and such an incredible child and I\\'m having such a great time being a mom but I still want to have a career and I still look forward to auditions and parts, and when I don\\'t get them I\\'m disappointed.;Busy Philipps;amazing 2428;I get to do the most amazing things. We call it Host in Peril quite often, because people love to see me risk my life or be in danger.;Rick Mercer;amazing 2429;My relationship with my mom is so amazing. We never got to have that stage that people go through, like when you\\'re 13 and you think you\\'re too cool for your parents. When you\\'re embarrassed by them and stuff. We never went through that because I was constantly working and she constantly had to be there.;Hilary Duff;amazing 2430;I guess winning an Oscar is the ultimate dream. A lot of amazing actors go their whole career without even being nominated. So that would definitely be a goal to reach. It\\'s a difficult one, but I\\'m aiming for it!;Taylor Lautner;amazing 2431;I wouldn\\'t be where I am today without the amazing public arts education that I had.;Matthew Morrison;amazing 2432;It\\'s pretty amazing being me.;Matthew Morrison;amazing 2433;Let me tell you, Barack Obama is the most down dude in the world, but he\\'s so smart so articulate, such an amazing speaker such a passionate man. He\\'s \\x0chumble.;Marlon Wayans;amazing 2434;It\\'s amazing how fast generations lose sight of other generations. One of the first things the young composers who come to work with me say is that they want to write music people will like, instead of gaining their credentials by being rejected by the audience.;Carlisle Floyd;amazing 2435;I always use my husband\\'s cocoa butter stuff. He has amazing skin!;Idina Menzel;amazing 2436;My wife is amazing. She had to know she was getting into a heap of trouble when we met.;Taylor Hanson;amazing 2437;I love getting dressed up. Being a pop star is the most brilliant job for that. A lot of girls love shopping, but they might see the most amazing outfit and think, \\'When am I going to wear that?\\', so it\\'s my duty to exploit the fact I do have events I can wear these things to.;Sophie Ellis- Bextor;amazing 2438;I have an amazing relationship with food.;Katharine McPhee;amazing 2439;I\\'ve been very fortunate to be able to jump around. I just did this really wonderful film called Map of the World. That was a real, amazing, dramatic story. Then I did a movie called Company Men, a little comedy about the Bay of Pigs.;Sigourney Weaver;amazing 2440;I wore my first pair of Louboutins during this press tour. It was absolutely amazing, they weren\\'t heels, they were little shoes, but they were velvet and they were blue.;Chloe Moretz;amazing 2441;I jetset around and play these songs and get to hang with some pretty amazing people, then I go home to a really great farm, though actually it\\'s a disaster area of a farm at the moment. But it\\'s certainly a blast. I wouldn\\'t trade lives with anyone right now.;Brad Paisley;amazing 2442;It feels amazing to work with writers that write really well.;Giancarlo Esposito;amazing 2443;So, you know, parenting is a very intimate and amazing experience and one of the best experiences of my life.;Uma Thurman;amazing 2444;My sister, she\\'s amazing. She sort of inspired me to take this journey to Latin America.;Jenna Bush;amazing \\x0c2445;Well, there are better cartoonists now than there ever have been. I firmly believe that. There\\'s some amazing work being done.;Chris Ware;amazing 2446;I\\'ve worn dresses from all different price ranges, and the thing that couture dresses have in common is that the fit is amazing.;Beyonce Knowles;amazing 2447;George Clooney is a super-human, he\\'s just such an amazing human being, he taught me how to be a better person and a better actor!;Shailene Woodley;amazing 2448;I mean, I\\'ve always said I have an amazing team and network of friends and people that I work with that, you know, inspire me and enable me to do what I do.;Alexander Wang;amazing 2449;I had an amazing experience working with great people. I had a great family, a typical family with drama in certain areas, and that\\'s pretty much everywhere in everyone\\'s life.;Tina Yothers;amazing 2450;It\\'s nice because success has allowed me to have a blast on stage, to be in the studio with amazing people, but I find it all a bit bizarre.;David Guetta;amazing 2451;It\\'s amazing what we can get away with and what we can\\'t. But it\\'s not for me to decide.;Mike Judge;amazing 2452;I feel fortunate I have this amazing relationship with so many people in America, because I was in their homes at a very private time of day. They probably might have still had their robe on and their slippers and haven\\'t made the beds.;Joan Lunden;amazing 2453;Science is one of a handful of things that defines us as a very special species. It is amazing how far we have been able to get and how accurate our predictions are. I think understanding how the universe was born is very important. It really gives us a perspective on many things.;Yuri Milner;amazing 2454;Isn\\'t it amazing how celebrity status preempts even the most ingrained hatreds?;Camryn Manheim;amazing 2455;I have experienced some amazing food! Yet when I think about the most luxurious and exquisite meals I have had, visions of simple food made from a few natural ingredients are what most excite me.;Mark \\x0cHyman;amazing 2456;I love to go shopping at Target. They have so much stuff there, you can buy almost anything, it\\'s really amazing.;Liv Tyler;amazing 2457;Growing up, I looked up to major league baseball players, and now these young women have amazing, incredible women all across the board, from swimming to gymnastics to softball to basketball.;Jennie Finch;amazing 2458;One thing that is almost always said to me is, I grew up with you. They are meeting me and feel that they actually grew up with me. I was with them during their play hours and thinking hours. I was a part of their childhoods. That\\'s one of the most amazing things.;Mark Goddard;amazing 2459;You know, it\\'s amazing. I don\\'t even have a car, would you believe it? I had a motorbike and it got stolen last year. So I\\'ve got to buy another one of those, I suppose. I can treat myself to that.;Michael Fassbender;amazing 2460;I know this is going to sound corny, but I love my life. I love my baby, so I love getting to wake up with him. And I have the most amazing job, with writing that any actor would love and costars who I can\\'t wait to see on Monday mornings. And I love coming home to my husband.;Julianna Margulies;amazing 2461;Reba McEntire came through town when I lived in Texas. She had this amazing theatrical show with, like, 13 different wardrobe changes. I was eight and I was like, Wow, I wanna do that!;LeAnn Rimes;amazing 2462;I don\\'t want to wake up and not truly be enjoying my life and these amazing things around me.;LeAnn Rimes;amazing 2463;But one of the amazing things about documentary is that you can remake it every time you make one. There is no rule about how a documentary film has to be made.;Errol Morris;amazing 2464;In fact, it is amazing how much European films - Italian, French, German and English - have recovered a certain territory of the audience in their countries over the last few years.;Wim Wenders;amazing 2465;I\\'m from Naples. I was born in a poor neighborhood and I always, in my heart, felt \\x0clike it would be amazing to be able to adopt a child from Naples. I could give someone the opportunity I had. I would love to give back in that way and pay it forward.;Giuliana Rancic;amazing 2466;I was writing a scene where a guy was choking another guy to death. You can go online and type \\'chokeholds\\' and watch scenes where martial artists choke each other out. You can hear what noises they make when they go unconscious, see how their bodies flop and everything. YouTube is amazing for the more detailed stuff.;Daniel H. Wilson;amazing 2467;That show, \\'The Amazing Race\\' - is that about white people?;Zach Galifianakis;amazing 2468;Each of us have things and thoughts and descriptions of an amazing universe in our possession that kings in the 17th Century would have gone to war to possess.;Kary Mullis;amazing 2469;With \\'The Host,\\' I think the actors could be really big names. That would be cool. I\\'d love to see Robert Redford put on a beard and be Jeb he would be amazing... Matt Damon has some very Jared- esque qualities, and then Casey Affleck as Ian and Ben Affleck as Kyle. Imagine the interplay.;Stephenie Meyer;amazing 2470;It\\'s amazing that no matter how much money you have, you can make some bad decisions, and in five months you\\'re on the street, begging.;Paz de la Huerta;amazing 2471;I mean, there is amazing amount of oil and gas and other resources out beneath the sea. It\\'s staggering.;Robert Ballard;amazing 2472;I grew up in a Christian home with amazing parents.;Allyson Felix;amazing 2473;When you\\'re offered things, it makes it so much easier to be indecisive. And it\\'s silly because you can pass on some really amazing things.;Alicia Silverstone;amazing 2474;It was amazing to watch him in the darkroom at an advanced age, still get excited when the results were pleasing. He still struggled like we all do in the darkroom and he struggled behind the camera, and when he had a success he was beaming.;John \\x0cSexton;amazing 2475;My parents were amazing and wonderful, but there was a lot of pressure to do my best and in every way possible.;Kate Bosworth;amazing 2476;Elizabeth Taylor. In her heyday, she was amazing.;Joe Jonas;amazing 2477;Adele\\'s amazing, I think the world of her and her music and I think Tinie Tempah is cool. To work with someone like Kanye West would be awesome.;Joe Jonas;amazing 2478;I\\'ve never stabbed, hurt, killed, stolen, anything, but I went to jail for a year. What is that? My pastor said to me the fact that I\\'m not living under a bridge as a crazy woman, talking to myself, is amazing.;Foxy Brown;amazing 2479;If you ever have the good fortune to meet Tippi Hedren, she\\'s an amazing woman. You can\\'t quite believe she is the age she is.;Toby Jones;amazing 2480;Katy Perry is the sexiest woman I\\'ve ever kissed. It was amazing and very purple - she had purple lipstick on. I don\\'t think there will ever be anything cooler than kissing her... until I marry her maybe!;Niall Horan;amazing 2481;They were so good that you just had to sing the song to them once and they got it. It\\'s amazing.

That was in itself something amazing - I was on the same space these guys stood on, ya know?;Alan Vega;amazing 2632;United Artists wanted to do records with me. I had no idea, what a rare thing that was... to make an album. And they put a guy with me working on songs, and I got busy with films. I just kind of let it slide. Isn\\'t that amazing?;John Astin;amazing 2633;Paul Farmer has helped to build amazing health care system in one of the poorest areas of Haiti.

You can be chatting with her and when they call action, she\\'s right there.;Lisa Kudrow;amazing 2640;My sister Jennifer is an Emmy winning journalist and mother of three amazing girls.

Let me help you look even better.\\' I think tearing someone down is an awful thing to do. It has a lasting impression on people.;Carson Kressley;amazing 2658;I think one of the coolest things about the job is the level of trust we have for each other. The actors fully trust that the writers will write amazing episodes, and the writers trust that the actors will follow their instincts with the characters.;John Krasinski;amazing \\x0c2659;Trophies and medals have never meant much to me. I\\'ve had amazing experiences, which let you feel like you\\'ve accomplished something.;John Krasinski;amazing 2660;Most of the people I know who work out seriously do so because they have such an amazing outlook on life.

So I decided to place them in a discreet location, such as the inside part of my bicep.;Jake Owen;amazing 2674;In editing, it\\'s amazing how you choose the in and out points.

It\\'s incredible.;Maria Menounos;amazing 2686;She\\'s 32, and she has three children. She loves to be pregnant but she doesn\\'t want anymore children in her life.

It\\'s been an amazing life.;Nile Rodgers;amazing 2689;I have never had trouble with any actor being able to visualise things. They are amazing.

But I\\'m not passionate about acting the way you probably should be to call yourself an actor.;Evangeline Lilly;amazing 2691;I was interested in transcendence from a very early age.

That wasn\\'t what I was after at all.;Anselm Kiefer;amazing 2692;Mark Conseulos is so amazing.;Lily Rabe;amazing 2693;Listen, a cable series is a beautiful thing because there\\'s such amazing writing happening on television, and it\\'s a schedule that allows you to do a play or two. There\\'s a reason everybody wants that job!;Lily Rabe;amazing 2694;The good Lord is amazing He opens up doors. I was close to abandoning the dream, and He was like, \\'Hey, slow down there, buddy. No, Arrested Development was such an amazing experience in every way, and you know it was very unique in that it was a show that received a lot of critical acclaim, and yet we didn\\'t ever achieve the ratings that we wanted. I stood for parliament with the amazing support and help of my ex-husband, but it\\'s not something that was handed to me like a peerage. I worked hard and was elected. So my achievements, such as they are, are my own. I\\'m not sure I make old bones in parliament. It\\'s an amazing experience to have had but I can\\'t see myself being Mother of the House. After all these years, it\\'s still amazing what Obama is allowed to get away with. He says low gas prices in 2009 were caused by a terrible economy, but then claims that the lower number of illegal aliens crossing the border is because of his border policies, not the same lousy economy. I think I came across Cecil Taylor a bit later, in 65 or 66. That really impressed me - Cecil Taylor is an amazing character... Both his music and the way he approaches the instrument are astonishing. \\x0cMy dream career would be to be in things that have real heart and are telling real stories but while doing that, you\\'re getting really big laughs. I don\\'t necessarily love the straight crazy comedies. \\'Caddyshack\\' is amazing, but there\\'s not a lot of new \\'Caddyshack\\'s. I get to travel around the world and meet all of these amazing people, and they\\'re singing my songs! And to me, that\\'s crazy. In the past few years, we\\'ve been doing amazing stuff with desserts. Pastry chefs have been using herbs and spices in their desserts. So vanilla cake doesn\\'t have to be just vanilla, it can have a little thyme. Or you could have a custard with a little lavender in it, which is just amazing. Southern California, they have been amazing. They\\'re totally with us. I auditioned for \\'Girls\\' the fall after I graduated from Yale. The show has been amazing - as close to perfect as it gets! Try as hard as we may for perfection, the net result of our labors is an amazing variety of imperfectness. We are surprised at our own versatility in being able to fail in so many different ways. I don\\'t get a chance to do many of my own stunts on \\'Buffy\\' - none of us do. We have amazing stunt people who make us all look really believable and really good. We\\'re all doing different things and some of the girls are mums, so priorities have changed. But I would love to do something with the Spice Girls again. I know we would have an amazing time. I like what I see now in China, but I think the Japanese are a step ahead into craziness and weirdness. I go to galleries there that are the size of a New York elevator, and every time I\\'m surprised by the amazing things I find. I really hope I\\'ll be able to promote some of these artists, to show their work in the West. You can be the best actor in the world, but if you don\\'t have that one lucky moment, it kind of doesn\\'t matter. There are a lot of amazing actors who will never get the chance to prove themselves because they won\\'t have that one lucky moment. The New York Quarterly is an amazing, intelligent, crazy, creative, strange, and indispensable magazine. \\x0cI\\'m having a great time. I get to travel and see the world. And yeah, I\\'ll have a family, because I don\\'t want to miss out on that amazing experience, but it\\'s not defining who I am. My family has been amazing, and they understand how blessed I am. They\\'ve been able to keep my sense of humor. I just had that conversation this morning with my doctor. I just got back from the hospital a half-hour ago, and nothing will make me happier than to replicate the DNA of my amazing husband. I\\'m optimistic. It was amazing that during rehearsals, without any of the costume on, the character was there complete. It just happened. Half the time, I didn\\'t know I was doing it. New Orleans in an amazing town. You can muck around with different guitars for certain bits, but you have to have your own sound. That\\'s your benchmark, that\\'s your sound. I also play a Black Beauty. It sounds amazing. Any day acting is an amazing day. It\\'s amazing that this is still news to people, but that affects the final outcome of the film. When people are treated well, and they\\'re made to feel valued, they give 110 percent. Chasing Amy\\' was an amazing role, but then after that, I went and did \\'Big Daddy\\' and you\\'re the girlfriend or you\\'re the best friend. I wasn\\'t getting the Nicole Kidman roles.;Joey Lauren Adams;amazing 2720;The Academy Awards was an amazing night. I know I kind of lost my mind a little bit. I apologize for that.

You read all these amazing young women going through different stages in their life - different stages, different fascinations, different textualities, different friendships.;Juno Temple;amazing 2728;I just did a part in \\'Sin City 2.\\' I got to do a scene with Ray Liotta. Amazing man, extraordinary gentleman who was just so kind to me... I\\'m so excited about that I think it\\'s gonna be very cool.;Juno Temple;amazing 2729;The thing that\\'s tricky is sometimes the best voices - just because someone hits the big notes and sounds amazing - it doesn\\'t necessarily mean they make the greatest artists.;Kara DioGuardi;amazing 2730;I love MySpace it\\'s done an amazing job for me and it\\'s been insane over the past couple of weeks, but I\\'m not a poster girl for them.;Lily Allen;amazing 2731;Actually, we got signed in November of 2000 with Dreamworks which is the most amazing label. We have friends on other labels and though we are not selling millions of records, yet, they treat us with tons of respect and give us some very good guidance.;Adam Rich;amazing 2732;I liked the way they treated the first, second, and third place finishers equally. It was an amazing year. I only entered two song contests this year I won one and placed second in the other. And I entered each of them a day or two before the deadline.;Arthur Godfrey;amazing 2733;Winning \\'The Apprentice\\' changed my life in ways I could never have imagined. It has been an amazing experience working for Donald Trump and I am very grateful for the whole opportunity.;Bill Rancic;amazing \\x0c2734;It\\'s amazing how everyone has an opinion on how you should live your life.;Sherry Stringfield;amazing 2735;The racing driver\\'s mind has to have the ability to have amazing anticipation, coordination, and reflex. Because of the speed the car goes.;Emerson Fittipaldi;amazing 2736;Well, it was the beginning of my film career. It was amazing to me that I got nominated for an Academy Award.;Sally Kellerman;amazing 2737;It doesn\\'t take money to have style, it just takes a really good eye.

Tony Scott is an important director, and has an amazing ability to express himself, and he doesn\\'t do it in musical terms , he does it in emotional terms. I got along really well with him.;Trevor Rabin;amazing 2740;Innovation is this amazing intersection between someone\\'s imagination and the reality in which they live. The problem is, many companies don\\'t have great imagination, but their view of reality tells them that it\\'s impossible to do what they imagine.;Ron Johnson;amazing 2741;My older brother Mike is an excellent trumpet player. By the time he was 12, he was playing around Kansas City in classical situations. He was already an amazing talent.;Pat Metheny;amazing 2742;I was about 14, and my friend\\'s stepdad asked me to do a 10K with him because his son - who was more into basketball - didn\\'t want to. It was amazing, and I still remember the time I got: 48:23.;Sean Astin;amazing 2743;It\\'s amazing to see places like Madison Square Garden on the schedule again.;Roger Andrew Taylor;amazing 2744;I love Prince Harry. Good looking and a bit of a rebel. Me and his dad are as thick as thieves and I knew Harry before I knew his dad so we\\'ve met a few times. I think he\\'s amazing. And I \\x0cthink you can relate to him because he\\'s made mistakes. He\\'s cool.;Cheryl Cole;amazing 2745;I would love to work with Anthony Hopkins I would love to work with Meryl Streep I would love to work with DeNiro I would love to work with Johnny Depp I\\'d love to work with Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow... I think she\\'s amazing.;Tara Reid;amazing 2746;At first I missed it, but it was the amazing energy thing that happened during shows, when a lot of people were like Yay Yay Yeah! I missed that for a while. But I don\\'t miss the regular and the business side of that whole thing.;Bill Kreutzmann;amazing 2747;I like making films about old people because they are repositories of amazing stories that they tell well. And they\\'re incredibly good telly.;Ian Hislop;amazing 2748;The opportunity, number one, to work with Ang Lee is an amazing thing for me.;Sam Elliott;amazing 2749;James Franco has this interesting and relaxed look. It\\'s pretty \\'I don\\'t care,\\' but it still looks good. Ryan Gosling also has amazing style. I take a lot of my fashion tips from those two. In my opinion, they\\'re the ones getting it right.;Josh Henderson;amazing 2750;My grandfather was one of the most amazing Baptist ministers in history, he was unbelievable. He was one of the most amazing men - the most amazing man that I ever met... He lived an amazing life.;Josh Henderson;amazing 2751;I spend up to two hours a day on correspondence.

You can cut out the middle man like the fan club... before a recent appearance in Tyler, Texas, I had fans reaching out on MySpace offering their lake house, Mavericks tickets. It was amazing.;Josh Henderson;amazing 2752;It was a wonderful experience to work with Sylvia. She pushed me to be more powerful with my acting, and she told me scores of the most incredible stories I\\'ve ever heard.

Everything is pink!;Jerry O\\'Connell;amazing 2754;It\\'s amazing how stress keeps you trim.;Peter Andre;amazing 2755;These things have a life of there own and never existed when I was growing up certainly worrying when one would get made. It\\'s kind of amazing how that one movie kept living through all these years.;Stockard Channing;amazing 2756;At 13, I realized that I could fix anything electronic. It was amazing, I could just do it. I started a business repairing radios. It grew to be one of the largest in Philadelphia.;Amar Bose;amazing 2757;It\\'s odd, because I used to see pictures, on telly or wherever, of what I now know to be Shaftesbury Avenue and I used to wonder what that amazing street with all the lights was. Well, now I know. I think when you get a wee taste of something, it maybe isn\\'t what you thought it was.;Shirley Henderson;amazing 2758;There was just this amazing individuality. It\\'s just a whole different world of optimism and fearlessness, women taking off their bras and dancing around naked, and a political hopefulness and involvement.;Jill Clayburgh;amazing 2759;The amazing thing now is that most of those so-called critics who were telling me to find my own voice seem to have lost theirs.;Brian Lumley;amazing 2760;Just going on the road and entertaining the fans, that\\'s amazing.;Jordan Knight;amazing 2761;If we get the capabilities, NATO, along with the European Union, can do amazing things.;Lord Robertson;amazing 2762;Acting is fantastic, but to be able to create a whole world on celluloid is amazing.

This is the most authentic and realistic soccer game I have ever seen. It is like I\\'m looking in a mirror. The attention to detail is incredible.;Claudio Reyna;amazing 2769;What\\'s amazing is that I\\'m recognized all over the world through \\'Red Dwarf.\\' British fans are exceptional, but the American fans are something else. Some of them fly 500 miles to stand in line for three hours, just to meet me, then when they do they collapse. It makes you feel like a rock star!;Craig Charles;amazing 2770;Just knowing that through my music I actually inspire people is amazing for me and I find it very heartwarming.;Thia Megia;amazing 2771;As far as the girls in my grade, it was always kind of an on-and-off thing.

I just think it is amazing!;Atticus Shaffer;amazing 2776;I feel like I\\'m really \\x0cblessed and lucky that I have a very good social life outside of the gym, and I have a really amazing family.

So I feel like I get the best of both worlds.;Aly Raisman;amazing 2777;Painting is the most magical of mediums.

I realized that sharks are amazing, beautiful animals who have absolutely no interest in checking me out.;Malin Akerman;amazing 2779;There were two things going on: 1) I had already established in my own mind where I wanted to go with the next series, and having James around as a Grey Eminence would have complicated matters.

I find it an amazing adventure.;Nigel Kennedy;amazing 2781;I\\'m overly excited to finally announce this amazing global partnership deal back home with EMI Music.

I never realized that I would get the support that I\\'ve gotten from everybody - from my fans, to people that I\\'ve \\x0cidolized my whole life.

We laugh all the time.;Nicole Sullivan;amazing 2875;I made some friends who are still friends, and this is the city of my birth. I love living here when there\\'s a \\x0creason to, other than just moving here. I still don\\'t like the winters here, but it\\'s an amazing city and I love it.;Michael McKean;amazing 2876;When I go outside of L.A., no matter where it is, really anywhere I go, people will be stopping me or taking pictures or whatever it is. And it\\'s great. It\\'s amazing. I\\'m just lucky.;Michael Welch;amazing 2877;You go through at least the first two years of Star Trek and you find some amazing stuff.

And you get to work with some amazing people, and goof off for four hours.;Jason Marsden;amazing 2882;Of all the planets apart from Earth in our solar system, Mars is the most hospitable. Yeah.

I think the progress the waterfront has made is amazing. It is amazing how the public steadfastly refuse to attend the third day of a match when so often the last day produces the best and most exciting cricket. Usher is amazing. He\\'s perfection to me as a performer. He gets down. I\\'m jamming \\'Black Sabbath Vol. 4\\' all the time. Zappa\\'s \\'Cruising With Ruben &amp The Jets.\\' A lot of Gong lately. Some Hawkwind. The Residents\\' \\'Duck Stab\\' is amazing. Some Fugs. Lots of stuff, man. I\\'m pretty schizophrenic with records. I don\\'t know if it has set in or not. Honestly, it\\'s crazy.

I\\'m proud to be a member of such an amazing cast - that\\'s the best award of all. I used the music kind of as therapy, and it\\'s just amazing that I feel so free after doing that. I feel like I had it trapped inside of me and now I feel free. So it\\'s been a very good therapy session for me as well. Some of the most amazing human beings on the face of the planet go to sci-fi conventions, although I\\'m sure a few of them wouldn\\'t admit it.

Sayles could pull a performance out of a dog. I\\'m serious. He was just amazing. The world could fall apart and he remained on neutral. I am auditioning again - getting back to theatre would be amazing. It\\'s so amazing to hear a crowd of people singing one of your songs. It\\'s the best feeling. We\\'ve always described our sound as a bit more guitar driven than normal pop music. Kind of Pink in a boy band form. We\\'ve heard a few people say that so now we use it. I think Pink is amazing person to be compared to. \\x0cI mean, it\\'s amazing that I get to meet all these people. I\\'ve learned so much from all of them. I just worked with Sofia Coppola and that was amazing. I learned so much from her. I can\\'t even describe how much fun I had. New York is the coolest city. The place just never sleeps. It\\'s amazing. Science fiction is an amazing literature: plot elements that you would think would be completely worn out by now keep changing into surprising new forms. It\\'s the degree of success and the length of time that is amazing. Music makes your soul feel amazing while you\\'re performing it. If we\\'re given a number of circumstances to deal with, the brain goes into this mode of trying to find a solution, and it\\'s amazing how good we are at it.

It\\'s amazing to see things that are suggested in the book fully developed and so brilliantly realized through the artistry of the designers. \\'Breaking Bad\\' is the best, the greatest, the most amazing thing I have ever watched on television. And Shanghai is amazing. I\\'m a fan of science fiction so when you\\'re there in the night with all the lights and all this modernity, it\\'s like a set in a movie. I think that we\\'re in a really amazing time, where there are really a lot of really fantastic female actresses and comedians. I imagine there\\'s just a lot of opportunity for women to have powerful roles. Or it\\'s just that there\\'s more women writing TV. Women tend to maybe write strong women. If I can help and influence girls who are going through body- image issues then I think that\\'s amazing. \\x0cMy dad was a journalist. He was in Rwanda right after the genocide. In Berlin when the wall came down. He was always disappearing and coming back with amazing stories. So telling stories for a living made sense to me. It was an amazing performer. Very temperamental, it spent a lot of time in its trailer. I had one drama teacher who was amazing, Ms. Perkins. She really tried to inspire me and get me going. You know, \\'The Golden Girls\\' was a very unusual show to start on. I was young, and it was a show about old people, and it was a very traditional show, but it was also an amazing training ground for a joke-writer. It forced me to learn those skills. It\\'s amazing the hours you pull when you\\'re the lead of a show. I\\'m crazy about my father, he\\'s an amazing man, a real adventurer. He took us with him to travel all over the world. We were in places that were so remote, that white people hardly ever reach them. Shanghai set out to take over from Hong Kong and I think it\\'s done that. It\\'s got the most amazing futuristic skyline which rivals and even betters Tokyo. My mom is a really good cook. I didn\\'t get the cooking gene, but she cooks this really amazing dinner every Christmas, and that\\'s always really fun. \\'True Blood\\' is amazing. I have to give a shout out to \\'Melrose Place\\' because I do watch. I love \\'Entourage.\\' One of my favorite shows back in the day was \\'Friday Night Lights.\" Everyone at home is so supportive. People recognise me, say how proud they are of me. It\\'s awesome to hear, it\\'s amazing to know I can touch so many people in a positive way. Ted Danson is amazing. He\\'s incredible. I had amazing stuff happen right off the top. I thought this was how it worked. Hollywood is awesome! Cut to three years later: What happened? \\x0cDespite the amazing diversity we\\'re blessed with in this country, schools are still in large part segregated because of economic disparity. Sports are one of the few areas where kids are really given the opportunity to interact with those of different races and religions.  It\\'s been an amazing year of individual performances. When you think of it I haven\\'t really done a lot of horror. It\\'s amazing: I have done some really good ones, but I haven\\'t done a lot of them. It\\'s amazing what you can get on open source now if you actually use the right search engines to find the material. It\\'s just amazing that there are so many prejudices even now. They played Boston. They played at the Boston Tea Party and through an amazing chain of events I got to hang out with them backstage even though I was underage. One of the amazing things about the Internet is that the content creators are the gatekeepers. We can think of an idea and execute it quickly, and we didn\\'t have to pitch the idea to a major network or convince a studio head to sign-off on the concept. I know plenty of actresses in their early thirties who look amazing, although there\\'s that old saying: \\'Ladies get older, men get more distinguished.\\' It\\'s amazing to me that, in the 42 years since President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law, women today still receive fewer wages than men for the same work. It is really quite amazing that all of the folks supporting privatization, from the president on down, keep invoking the name of my grandfather, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. To make a couple putts to win the Masters is just an amazing feeling. It is amazing that it is my destiny to be the first Aussie to win the Masters. I want to buy my mom a house I want my family to never have to worry about anything. And I just want to have an amazing career in music, because I love to do it. Steven Tyler is awesome. He is so humble. He\\'s really sweet and coming from him and his career, it\\'s amazing. \\x0cThe best part is it\\'s a dream come true. I\\'ve always wanted to be a working actor, and the good part of it... it\\'s all good! I work long hours, but it\\'s amazing. They pay me. That\\'s amazing! I get to kiss Keri Russell, and that ain\\'t too bad. I got to work with Jennifer Tilly, she was amazing. Such, such a smart actress. I listen to every thing, all kinds of stuff. I\\'ve been obsessed with the Nas and Damian Marley record, \\'Distant Relatives.\\' I feel like a lot of people haven\\'t heard it, and it\\'s amazing.  I have the most amazing support network around me. I enjoy looking at words on paper and visualizing how to make them come to life. As a director, the creative process is really amazing. It\\'s so amazing, standing on the corner -this happened in Washington, D.C. - and somebody comes by in a Cadillac and you hear \\'Manic Monday\\' on the radio, and you don\\'t even know this person, and they\\'re listening to it and singing along with it. Wow! Blows your mind. The past 6 and a half years have been the most amazing years of my life. It\\'s sad it has come to an end but Avril and I are still family and moving forward in the most positive way possible. Having my first number one single and being able to travel to places I\\'ve never been before has been amazing. The tour was also fantastic. There are so many things which I\\'ve experienced this year which I never even dreamed of. The Beethoven Experience provided the opportunity to solidify the relationship between the Orchestra and me, the Orchestra and me and the public, between all of us and the city of New York, because Beethoven after all is a really amazing point of reference. Maggie Smith is an amazing woman, and not as serious in real life. Janet Jackson is an icon, I\\'ve been honored to meet her a few times, working with her would be amazing. What do I think of L.A.? It\\'s boring, with some amazing nuggets. Like there are some parts of it that are great, but by and large I think it\\'s quite boring. I think Andrew Stanton is such an amazing, creative mind. It\\'s amazing... to enjoy the results of your labor. \\x0cI think Gina Rowlands is an amazing actress. Obviously, there\\'s the seedy side of the strip club world and pole dancing. But, pole dancing, as an art form, is really beautiful. It\\'s been hyper-sexualized because it\\'s associated with strippers, but if you think about it, just in terms of other kinds of dancing, they\\'re using an instrument to create these amazing dance forms. The fact that I even get in Broadway shows is, to me, still amazing, but then to win a Tony was just incredible.  I just feel energized when I am around young, talented people. There is something about these kids that\\'s amazing. I learn as much from them as they do from me. It\\'s amazing that something only an atom thick can be an impenetrable barrier. You can have gas on one side and vacuum or liquid on the other, and with a wall only one atom thick, nothing would go through it. Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else you are the one who gets burned. Anybody can become angry - that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way - that is not within everybody\\'s power and is not easy. Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured. Anger dwells only in the bosom of fools. Bitterness is like cancer. It eats upon the host. But anger is like fire. It burns it all clean. In a controversy the instant we feel anger we have already ceased striving for the truth, and have begun striving for ourselves. For every minute you remain angry, you give up sixty seconds of peace of mind. Anger and intolerance are the enemies of correct understanding. Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret. When angry, count to four when very angry, swear. When angry count to ten before you speak. If very angry, count to one hundred. Man should forget his anger before he lies down to sleep. Whatever is begun in anger ends in shame. \\x0cUsually when people are sad, they don\\'t do anything. They just cry over their condition. But when they get angry, they bring about a change. When anger rises, think of the consequences. A man who has never made a woman angry is a failure in life. It is impossible for you to be angry and laugh at the same time. Anger and laughter are mutually exclusive and you have the power to choose either. Anger is a killing thing: it kills the man who angers, for each rage leaves him less than he had been before - it takes something from him. Don\\'t get the impression that you arouse my anger. You see, one can only be angry with those he respects. Get mad, then get over it. He who angers you conquers you. Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, nor hell a fury like a woman scorned. Beware of him that is slow to anger for when it is long coming, it is the stronger when it comes, and the longer kept. Abused patience turns to fury. Never go to bed mad. Stay up and fight. There are two things a person should never be angry at, what they can help, and what they cannot. Anger and jealousy can no more bear to lose sight of their objects than love. When you are offended at any man\\'s fault, turn to yourself and study your own failings. Then you will forget your anger. How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it. Anger, if not restrained, is frequently more hurtful to us than the injury that provokes it. A man that studieth revenge keeps his own wounds green. Hatred is an affair of the heart contempt that of the head. Be not angry that you cannot make others as you wish them to be, since you cannot make yourself as you wish to be. Every time you get angry, you poison your own system. Anger is a wind which blows out the lamp of the mind. Speak when you are angry - and you\\'ll make the best speech you\\'ll ever regret. Anger is a short madness. Anger makes dull men witty, but it keeps them poor. \\x0cAn angry man opens his mouth and shuts his eyes. The deferring of anger is the best antidote to anger. If a small thing has the power to make you angry, does that not indicate something about your size? Never do anything when you are in a temper, for you will do everything wrong. Always write angry letters to your enemies. Never mail them. Let us not look back in anger, nor forward in fear, but around in awareness. One should not lose one\\'s temper unless one is certain of getting more and more angry to the end. He that would be angry and sin not, must not be angry with anything but sin. There is nothing that so much gratifies an ill tongue as when it finds an angry heart. No man can think clearly when his fists are clenched. Never go to bed angry, stay up and fight. Anger is one of the sinews of the soul. Never contend with a man who has nothing to lose. Revenge is often like biting a dog because the dog bit you. How often it is that the angry man rages denial of what his inner self is telling him. Fair peace becomes men ferocious anger belongs to beasts. Keep cool anger is not an argument. The world needs anger. The world often continues to allow evil because it isn\\'t angry enough. Somebody hits me, I\\'m going to hit him back. Even if it does look like he hasn\\'t eaten in a while. A wonderful emotion to get things moving when one is stuck is anger. It was anger more than anything else that had set me off, roused me into productivity and creativity. Experts say you should never hit your children in anger. When is a good time? When you\\'re feeling festive? Discussion is an exchange of knowledge an argument an exchange of ignorance. Expressing anger is a form of public littering. I know of no more disagreeable situation than to be left feeling generally angry without anybody in particular to be angry at. You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger. \\x0cForgiveness is the economy of the heart... forgiveness saves the expense of anger, the cost of hatred, the waste of spirits. In our daily life, we encounter people who are angry, deceitful, intent only on satisfying their own needs. There is so much anger, distrust, greed, and pettiness that we are losing our capacity to work well together. Generally speaking, if a human being never shows anger, then I think something\\'s wrong. He\\'s not right in the brain. Anger is the enemy of non- violence and pride is a monster that swallows it up. In times of great stress or adversity, it\\'s always best to keep busy, to plow your anger and your energy into something positive. Holding on to anger, resentment and hurt only gives you tense muscles, a headache and a sore jaw from clenching your teeth. Forgiveness gives you back the laughter and the lightness in your life. I know, to banish anger altogether from one\\'s breast is a difficult task. It cannot be achieved through pure personal effort. It can be done only by God\\'s grace. We should meet abuse by forbearance. Human nature is so constituted that if we take absolutely no notice of anger or abuse, the person indulging in it will soon weary of it and stop. Anger is never without a reason, but seldom with a good one. Speak the truth, do not yield to anger give, if thou art asked for little by these three steps thou wilt go near the gods. Anger is a manifestation of a deeper issue... and that, for me, is based on insecurity, self-esteem and loneliness. I think my passion is misinterpreted as anger sometimes. And I don\\'t think people are ready for the message that I\\'m delivering, and delivering with a sense of violent love. The components of anxiety, stress, fear, and anger do not exist independently of you in the world. They simply do not exist in the physical world, even though we talk about them as if they do. \\x0cMy recipe for dealing with anger and frustration: set the kitchen timer for twenty minutes, cry, rant, and rave, and at the sound of the bell, simmer down and go about business as usual. It is wise to direct your anger towards problems - not people to focus your energies on answers - not excuses. What I needed most was to love and to be loved, eager to be caught. Happily I wrapped those painful bonds around me and sure enough, I would be lashed with the red-hot pokers or jealousy, by suspicions and fear, by burst of anger and quarrels. There\\'s nothing wrong with anger provided you use it constructively. Love implies anger. The man who is angered by nothing cares about nothing. I have not lost faith in God. I have moments of anger and protest. Sometimes I\\'ve been closer to him for that reason. Hurt leads to bitterness, bitterness to anger, travel too far that road and the way is lost. The ignorant mind, with its infinite afflictions, passions, and evils, is rooted in the three poisons. Greed, anger, and delusion. Anger cannot be dishonest. I don\\'t think that you can fake warmth. You can fake lust, jealousy, anger those are all quite easy. But actual, genuine warmth? I don\\'t think you can fake it. Genuine forgiveness does not deny anger but faces it head- on. Anger ventilated often hurries towards forgiveness anger concealed often hardens into revenge. Anger: an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured. Anger is the most impotent of passions. It effects nothing it goes about, and hurts the one who is possessed by it more than the one against whom it is directed. My friends, love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And we\\'ll change the world. The greatest remedy for anger is delay. Experiencing sadness and anger can make you feel more creative, and by being creative, you can get beyond your pain or negativity. \\x0cThe greatest remedy for anger is delay. Anger is like those ruins which smash themselves on what they fall. Guilt is anger directed at ourselves - at what we did or did not do. Resentment is anger directed at others - at what they did or did not do. We\\'re taught to be ashamed of confusion, anger, fear and sadness, and to me they\\'re of equal value to happiness, excitement and inspiration. I realized that if my thoughts immediately affect my body, I should be careful about what I think. Now if I get angry, I ask myself why I feel that way. If I can find the source of my anger, I can turn that negative energy into something positive. I\\'m not as angry as I used to be. But I can get in touch with that anger pretty quickly if I feel my space is being invaded or somebody is not treating me with the respect that I think I want. The more anger towards the past you carry in your heart, the less capable you are of loving in the present. It isn\\'t enough just to scream at the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations. We need our political system to start reflect this anger back into, \\'How do we fix it? How do we get the economy going again?\\' Hatred is inveterate anger. There\\'s a lot of bitterness, there\\'s a lot of anger out there. We all have to work hard to heal those wounds. The only justice is to follow the sincere intuition of the soul, angry or gentle. Anger is just, and pity is just, but judgement is never just. Hatred is settled anger. Obama and his attack dogs have nothing but hate and anger in their hearts and spew it whenever possible. You must never be satisfied with losing. You must get angry, terribly angry, about losing. But the mark of the good loser is that he takes his anger out on himself and not his victorious opponents or on his teammates. The fear really hits you. That\\'s what you feel first. And then it\\'s the anger and frustration. Part of the problem is how little we understand about the ultimate betrayal of the body when it rebels against itself. \\x0cActing in anger and hatred throughout my life, I frequently precipitated what I feared most, the loss of friendships and the need to rely upon the very people I\\'d abused. The one who cannot restrain their anger will wish undone, what their temper and irritation prompted them to do. Be modest, humble, simple. Control your anger. People are always angry at America. They\\'re absolutely certain that America either caused their problems or is deliberately not fixing their problems. But the anger is always directed at America and never at Americans. You\\'ve just got to have a sense of respect for the person you have children with. Anger doesn\\'t help anybody. Ultimately you have to say forgiveness is important, and honoring what you had together is important. But it\\'s easy to say and harder to do. As far as having peace within myself, the one way I can do that is forgiving the people who have done wrong to me. It causes more stress to build up anger. Peace is more productive.  The voice of the intelligence is drowned out by the roar of fear. It is ignored by the voice of desire. It is contradicted by the voice of shame. It is biased by hate and extinguished by anger. Most of all it is silenced by ignorance. The world in general doesn\\'t know what to make of originality it is startled out of its comfortable habits of thought, and its first reaction is one of anger. I\\'d be lying if I said I wasn\\'t angry some days. But I really have worked hard to put a lot of the anger and disappointment in the past. Five enemies of peace inhabit with us - avarice, ambition, envy, anger, and pride if these were to be banished, we should infallibly enjoy perpetual peace. Lawyers are men who hire out their words and anger. It\\'s a joke to think that anyone is one thing. We\\'re all such complex creatures. But if I\\'m going to be a poster child for anything, anger\\'s a gorgeous emotion. It gets a bad rap, but it can make great changes happen. \\x0cAnger will never disappear so long as thoughts of resentment are cherished in the mind. Anger will disappear just as soon as thoughts of resentment are forgotten. Do not follow vain desires for verily he who prospers is preserved from lust, greed and anger. All those who offer an opinion on any doubtful point should first clear their minds of every sentiment of dislike, friendship, anger or pity. I really believe that all of us have a lot of darkness in our souls. Anger, rage, fear, sadness. I don\\'t think that\\'s only reserved for people who have horrible upbringings. I think it really exists and is part of the human condition. I think in the course of your life you figure out ways to deal with that. Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger. When I was younger, I was terrified to express anger because it would often kick- start a horrible reaction in the men in my life. So I bit my tongue. I was left to painstakingly deal with the aftermath of my avoidance later in life, in therapy or through the lyrics of my songs.  The flame of anger, bright and brief, sharpens the barb of love. What starts the process, really, are laughs and slights and snubs when you are a kid. If your anger is deep enough and strong enough, you learn that you can change those attitudes by excellence, personal gut performance. Although you may spend your life killing, You will not exhaust all your foes. But if you quell your own anger, your real enemy will be slain. The opposite of anger is not calmness, its empathy. A lot of my humor does come from anger. It\\'s like, you\\'re not gonna pull one over on me - which is pretty much my motto anyways. President Obama clearly cannot run on his record. All he\\'s offering is more of the same. That\\'s not good. Look at the economy. It\\'s stagnating. And so, what they\\'re now going to try and do is bring this campaign down to little things, distractions, distortions, smear, fear, anger, frustration. \\x0cTo talk about balance, it\\'s easier to talk about what\\'s out of balance. And I think anytime that you have any disease, and disease meaning lack of ease, lack of flow... dis-ease. So any time there\\'s disease, you\\'re out of balance, whether it\\'s jealousy, anger, greed, anxiety, fear. People are unjust to anger - it can be enlivening and a lot of fun. Anger is never without an argument, but seldom with a good one. All anger is not sinful, because some degree of it, and on some occasions, is inevitable. But it becomes sinful and contradicts the rule of Scripture when it is conceived upon slight and inadequate provocation, and when it continues long. George wrote Taxman, and I played guitar on it. He wrote it in anger at finding out what the taxman did. He had never known before then what could happen to your money. Grab the broom of anger and drive off the beast of fear. I don\\'t think your ability to fight has anything to do with how big you are. It\\'s to do with how much anger is in you. Like fragile ice anger passes away in time. My therapist says I still haven\\'t got in touch with my anger. Maybe one day I\\'m going to explode. But I\\'m still really happy. I know it looks like a strange and painful upbringing - all those experiences led me to the paths that I\\'m on now.  When someone says that I\\'m angry it\\'s actually a compliment. I have not always been direct with my anger in my relationships, which is part of why I\\'d write about it in my songs because I had such fear around expressing anger as a woman. I think I\\'m basically the same guy I always was. Maybe I\\'ve learned, through experience, to rein in some of the anger and temper they say redheads normally have. Growing up in a particular neighborhood, growing up in a working-class family, not having much money, all of those things fire you and can give you an edge, can give you an anger. Well, all comedy starts with anger. You get angry, and its never for a good reason, right? You know its not a good reason. And then you try and work it from there. \\x0cWhat influenced me was Tori Amos, who was unapologetic about expressing anger through music, and Sinead O\\'Connor. Those two in particular were really moving for me, and very inspiring, before I wrote \\'Jagged Little Pill.\\' Anger is as a stone cast into a wasp\\'s nest. My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, for man\\'s anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires. I\\'m an angry person, angrier than most people would imagine, I get flashes of anger. What works for me is working out when it\\'s useful to use that anger. Quite a lot of our contemporary culture is actually shot through with a resentment of limits and the passage of time, anger at what we can\\'t do, fear or even disgust at growing old. Words can be said in bitterness and anger, and often there seems to be an element of truth in the nastiness. And words don\\'t go away, they just echo around. Religion can emerge in all forms of feeling: here wild anger, there the sweetest pain here consuming hatred, there the childlike smile of serene humility. Fantastic tyrant of the amorous heart. How hard thy yoke, how cruel thy dart. Those escape your anger who refuse your sway, and those are punished most, who most obey. I turned to music originally because of my past and needing a release or an outlet to get out anger or frustration or hurt. Wars spring from unseen and generally insignificant causes, the first outbreak being often but an explosion of anger. I have to say that anger is the blanket that comes around me, and that blunts and blurs my sense of proportion. I\\'m fascinated by rap and by hip-hop. I think there\\'s a lot of poetry in it. There\\'s a lot of anger, a lot of social energy in it. And I think you\\'d better listen to it pretty carefully, \\'cause it\\'s important. The bare recollection of anger kindles anger. There was never an angry man that thought his anger unjust. \\x0cI think we all have a lot of darkness in our bellies. As an actor, the challenge of tapping into that, reaching down into that sadness or anger, is very therapeutic. Allowing children to show their guilt, show their grief, show their anger, takes the sting out of the situation. I think that Scottish people, like Canadians, are often misunderstood and what I like about my Scottish friends and relatives is how quickly it can go from love to anger. It\\'s a great dynamic. He who is incapable of feeling strong passions, of being shaken by anger, of living in every sense of the word, will never be a good actor. Anger may repast with thee for an hour, but not repose for a night the continuance of anger is hatred, the continuance of hatred turns malice. Yeah, to me, acting is very therapeutic. I get out a lot of anger and frustration. I grew up looking at my father as to how to behave. In watching him I grasped so many things. His own temperament was of a calm person. He was very composed and I never saw anger in him. To me, that was fascinating. All who consult on doubtful matters, should be void of hatred, friendship, anger, and pity. Men make angry music and it\\'s called rock-and-roll women include anger in their vocabulary and suddenly they\\'re angry and militant. I\\'ve been trying to learn how to not be so conflicted about things like my own anger. I\\'ve always had a place in my music for my anger as a way of compensating for not having a mechanism to express it in my everyday life. So I\\'ve been trying to be more true to myself, and that helps me to chill out a little bit. But politically, uh-uh. No. Shock, confusion, fear, anger, grief, and defiance. On Sept. 11, 2001, and for the three days following the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil, President George W. Bush led with raw emotion that reflected the public\\'s whipsawing stages of acceptance. For me music is a vehicle to bring our pain to the surface, getting it back to that humble and tender spot where, with luck, it can lose its anger and become compassion again. \\x0cIn plain terms, a child is a complicated creature who can drive you crazy. There\\'s a cruelty to childhood, there\\'s an anger. Anger is an expensive luxury in which only men of certain income can indulge. I\\'m not a screamer. I\\'m confrontational, but I don\\'t think that translates into anger. All through life I\\'ve harbored anger rather than expressed it at the moment. My passion and energy get mistaken for anger. When we can lay down our fear and anger and choose responses other than aggression, we create the conditions for bringing out the best in us humans. Your anger is a gift. At the time, 1980, people regarded actresses involved with production with a certain amount of fear, resentment and anger. The great thing about celebrity culture is that they can\\'t seem to stop themselves from displaying their ridiculous behaviour. I feel it\\'s my job as a serious investigative journalist to witness all kinds of behaviour and then report back to the audience through the prism of my own anger and bitterness. In general I was a good kid. It usually took a lot to make me mad. But once I reached the boiling point, I lost all rational control. Totally without thinking, when my anger was aroused, I grabbed the nearest brick, rock, or stick to bash someone. It was as if I had no conscious will in the matter. Anger elicits anger, fear elicits fear, no matter how well meaning we may be. Anger and hate against one we love steels our hearts, but contempt or pity leaves us silent and ashamed. I have a right to my anger, and I don\\'t want anybody telling me I shouldn\\'t be, that it\\'s not nice to be, and that something\\'s wrong with me because I get angry. I have some anger issues. The intoxication of anger, like that of the grape, shows us to others, but hides us from ourselves. \\x0cThe upside to anger? Getting it out of your system. You got to express your anger. Then you have room for more positive things. If I hold something in a long time, and then I speak it, it\\'s amazing how the light shines so much brighter. I drank for about 25 years getting over the loss of my father and I took the anger out on myself. I did a good job at beating myself up at sometimes. I don\\'t drink anymore but my alcoholic head occasionally says different. \\'Nil By Mouth\\' was a love letter to my father because I needed to resolve some issues in order to be able to forgive him. Anger has a way of seeping into every other emotion and planting itself in there. Anger is a great force. If you control it, it can be transmuted into a power which can move the whole world. It\\'s usually a big kind of vent of frustration or anger or sadness that puts me in the right frame of mind to write. It\\'s such a cliche to say that artists write when they\\'re down, but it\\'s true for me. It\\'s a relief to get out what\\'s eating away at my heart or my soul or my head. Anger tears me up inside... My own... or anyone else\\'s. He took over anger to intimidate subordinates, and in time anger took over him. We are losing sight of civility in government and politics. Debate and dialogue is taking a back seat to the politics of destruction and anger and control. Dogma has replaced thoughtful discussion between people of differing views. I don\\'t play pyrotechnic scales. I play about frustration, patience, anger. Music is an extension of my soul. I\\'m not someone who feels anger on particular issues. Take the high road. No matter how much strife, and consternation, frustration and anger you might be confronted with - don\\'t go to that level. Something my mum taught me years and years and years ago, is life\\'s just too short to carry around a great bucket- load of anger and resentment and bitterness and hatreds and all that sort of stuff. My humour has always come from anger, but I have to make sure I don\\'t just get angry and jump on a soapbox. Anger is a good motivator. \\x0cAnd I think there\\'s something about conservatives frankly - and the Left, when it comes to their channels of persuasion, are unpersuasive. They are, most of them are hate-filled, obscenity-clogged rants of anger and hatred. If anger proceeds from a great cause, it turns to fury if from a small cause, it is peevishness and so is always either terrible or ridiculous. I accrued anger from people\\'s low opinion of me and my work, and for the work I might be capable of. I\\'ve learned that football sometimes was an outlet. It was a way for me to release anger, release frustration. Anger is a momentary madness, so control your passion or it will control you. It\\'s a very difficult thing for people to accept, seeing women act out anger on the screen. We\\'re more accustomed to seeing men expressing rage and women crying. He best keeps from anger who remembers that God is always looking upon him. I did not want to put myself on the line, as an Australian playing Britain\\'s greatest comic actor. The fans of Sellers are obsessive, possessive - and aggressive. I did not want to risk their anger - or my own reputation. On banks, I make no apology for attacking spivs and gamblers who did more harm to the British economy than Bob Crow could achieve in his wildest Trotskyite fantasies, while paying themselves outrageous bonuses underwritten by the taxpayer. There is much public anger about banks and it is well deserved. Whether one agrees or disagrees with the tactics of the Occupy Wall Street movement, it\\'s easy to understand the inspiration for its anger as well as its impatience. When you learn that a truth is a lie, anger follows. Good satire comes from anger. It comes from a sense of injustice, that there are wrongs in the world that need to be fixed. And what better place to get that well of venom and outrage boiling than a newsroom, because you\\'re on the front lines. \\x0cIn high school I dated a white woman. She would come to visit me on the rez. And her dad, who was very racist, didn\\'t like that at all. And he told her one time, \\'You shouldn\\'t go on the rez if you\\'re white because Indians have a lot of anger in their heart.\\' People have said I\\'m the candidate of anger. Well, we have a right to be angry. We lost 3 million jobs. We lost our place as the moral leader of the world. I think anger and laughter are very close to each other, when you think about it. All improv turns into anger. All comedy improv basically turns into anger, because that\\'s all people know how to do when they\\'re improvising. If you notice shows that are improvising are generally people yelling at each other. As the plane got closer to Miami, I had this terrible feeling he was dying. Maybe he was telling me that he was going. I felt anger, panic, despair and helplessness. Men are fair, and they have learned not to personalize anger - they can disagree with you and argue to the bone, but afterward they still consider you a nice person with whom the underlying human relationship need not be altered. I guess because I had such a horrible life growing up, going from place to place not knowing what I was gonna do and ending up being homeless, there was a lot of pain and a lot of anger that was coming out through my guitar playing. Wise anger is like fire from a flint: there is great ado to get it out and when it does come, it is out again immediately. I had a lot of anger because I wasn\\'t happy with the way I had been raised. So I\\'m not worried about the emotions I carry with me, because I\\'m happy that I have them I think it\\'s good for the work I do. The emotions that are not healthy are the ones you hold inside, like anger. But one of the hardest things for me to do was to access anger. I could do it on stage. But when I did it on film it was hard for me. That probably has to do with the intimacy of film. And my own personal issues with expressing anger. So I had to learn how to do that. To rule one\\'s anger is well to prevent it is better. \\x0cI was able to do To Sleep with Anger, a very powerful film about African Americans, their spirituality, and the things that happened within a small community and a family. The anger of lovers renews their love. Life is precious and there\\'s not a lot of room for anger. I think I would cope like anyone copes with any tragedy. I\\'m sure I would be very upset for a while and then there would come a point where I would either have to stay in this place of darkness and anger, or I\\'d have to accept that it happened. Everybody kind of perceives me as being angry. It\\'s not anger, it\\'s motivation. There are people still in the Republican Party that I believe practice the communication of anger, of disappointment, of regret, of pain, of sorrow, of suffering. That\\'s not what the American people want to hear. I\\'ve purged myself of bitterness and anger and remained open to love. Imagine a thousand more such daily intrusions in your life, every hour and minute of every day, and you can grasp the source of this paranoia, this anger that could consume me at any moment if I lost control. There is an element of anger among women who\\'ve been raped. There\\'s certainly a major element of humiliation. But it really does seem like a medical condition of shock and horror. When you start suppressing feelings at an early age, it hurts you down the road. Full expression of anger and pain is very important. I was very fortunate to play sports. All the anger in me went out. I had to do what I had to do. If you stay angry all the time, then you really don\\'t have a good life. I understand Tea Partyers\\' anger with the system, but they are in way over their heads and often racially motivated, and I can\\'t be part of that. I do like to write nasty songs. It\\'s a useful weapon to have, and it\\'s cathartic as well, because I create art out of anger, something positive out of something negative. As a culture I see us as presently deprived of subtleties. The music is loud, the anger is elevated, sex seems lacking in sweetness and privacy. \\x0cI was a pretty angry kid, and I got into military history largely as a way to vent my own anger. As I got older it narrowed down to a more specific focus on individual violence. I\\'m just trying to understand where it came from. I get in trouble when I say things like, \\'I\\'m attracted to violence.\\' I was a pretty angry kid, and I got into military history largely as a way to vent my own anger. As I got older it narrowed down to a more specific focus on individual violence. I\\'m just trying to understand where it came from. Anger is a transient hatred or at least very like it. That\\'s the conundrum of cartoon stripping, as opposed to political cartoons. When your anger is the driving force of your drawing hand, failure follows. The anger is OK, but it has to serve the interests of the heart, frankly. Generalised anger and frustration is something that gets you in the studio, and gets you to work - though it\\'s not necessarily evident in anything that\\'s finished. Most men\\'s anger about religion is as if two men should quarrel for a lady they neither of them care for. But on second thought, after I decreed the state of emergency, I came to the conclusion that that was impossible to achieve without bloodshed because the street protesters were full of anger and nearly out of control. This is why I thought we needed to find another way out. I suppose there\\'s an anger in all of us. Some hidden rage that you keep at bay. Deep down, my mom had long suspected I was gay... Much of her anger and hurt came from her sense of betrayal that she was the last to be told. I\\'m generally quite an angry person, and I like to channel my anger toward something creative. I think there is a big difference between expressing the pain and anger that many African Americans and other people of color may feel versus language that I think now crosses the line and goes into hate. \\x0cBeing told about the effects of climate change is an appeal to our reason and to our desire to bring about change. But to see that Africans are the hardest hit by climate change, even though they generate almost no greenhouse gas, is a glaring injustice, which also triggers anger and outrage over those who seek to ignore it. I\\'ve spent a lot of time and money trying to keep my anger in control. Fear is the only true enemy, born of ignorance and the parent of anger and hate. The anger of a person who is strong, can always bide its time. Anger begins with folly, and ends with repentance. I am ready to accept all accusations, allegations, anger - but I have to succeed. Indulge not thyself in the passion of anger it is whetting a sword to wound thine own breast, or murder thy friend. I guess lyrically they\\'re similar because they\\'re talking about escaping the kind of misery that likes company. \\'The Last One Alive,\\' for me, is very simple. It\\'s just about alienation, really, that causes anger. What if you threw a protest and no one showed up? The lack of angst and anger and emotion is a big positive. I did not think that I was angry, but clearly anger was reflected in my writing. I did not think that I had been affected emotionally, but it was clear from my writing that I was still very emotional about the trial some six months after it ended. Every child senses, with all the horse sense that\\'s in him, that any parent is angry inside when children misbehave and they dread more the anger that is rarely or never expressed openly, wondering how awful it might be. I was never jailed. The fact is that I was arrested, but I went into a diversion programme, and by that time I\\'d already begun working in what was called anger management. It was a painful and awful moment. Keep your temper. A decision made in anger is never sound. Because society would rather we always wore a pretty face, women have been trained to cut off anger. \\x0cUnless and until Barack Obama addresses the full depth of Americans\\' anger with his full arsenal of policy smarts and political gifts, his presidency and, worse, our economy will be paralyzed. The Anger Management Tour was another beautiful thing. I loved that tour. I\\'ve always turned my anger inwards towards self- destruction. Our task, of course, is to transmute the anger that is affliction into the anger that is determination to bring about change. I think, in fact, that one could give that as a definition of revolution. Bosnia is under my skin. It\\'s the place you cannot leave behind. I was obsessed by the nightmare of it all there was this sense of guilt, and an anger that has become something much deeper over these last years. Our second phase was to develop a school curriculum that teaches tolerance, respect for differences, conflict resolution, anger management, and other attributes of peace. The American people are smart. They\\'ve gotten sick of the predictable hyperpartisan talking points and canned anger. I share the anger, but, ultimately, to govern this country, it takes more than anger. It takes experience. It takes positions that reflect the best values of the American people. If either player abandon the game by quitting the table in anger, or in an otherwise offensive manner or by momentarily resigning the game or refuses to abide by the decision of the Umpire, the game must be scored against him. After my second-to-last record, \\'The Greatest\\', I had gone on tour for a while, and I didn\\'t play an instrument for about five years. And I got kind of - it\\'s not self-esteem or whatever, or anger toward myself - but disappointed in myself that I hadn\\'t been challenging myself to learn musically. That feeds anger, and I mean when we went and at last thank heavens got towards peace in Northern Ireland we went for justice within Northern Ireland as well as using security well, as well as a political settlement, but surely that is the lesson. \\x0cAnd we know there has been horrendous loss of life and suffering and we know that there is anger. Anyone who came anywhere near the general election in constituencies with a substantial Muslim population knows that.  Anger may be kindled in the noblest breasts: but in these slow droppings of an unforgiving temper never takes the shape of consistency of enduring hatred. I\\'ve chosen my wedding ring large and heavy to continue forever. But exactly because of that all the time that Dave and I have an argument I feel it like handcuffs, and on anger time I throw it in a basket. Poor Dave, he bought me three wedding rings already! So many women keep their anger inside and let it build until they explode and then people blow them off again. Anger\\'s not a good emotion. I also had to work through the violation of my date rape, my unhealthy relationships with men, my anger toward the people involved in the scandal, and those who exploited me afterwards. Fairest and dearest, your wrath and anger are more heavy than I can bear but learn that I cannot tell what you wish me to say without sinning against my honour too grievously. Violence is a problem we all want to solve. I want to make sure that kids learn to deal with anger by learning how to talk with people to solve problems. Here in the United States Senate I want to make sure we have safe schools, safe neighborhoods and good things for kids to do after school! My heart has been heavy and I have deliberated within my own conscience, knowing that my decision should not come out of my initial emotion of anger toward the President for such reckless behavior, but should be based on the facts. Insurgents have capitalized on popular resentment and anger towards the United States and the Iraqi government to build their own political, financial and military support, and the faith of Iraqi citizens in their new government has been severely undermined. \\x0cI had a lot of anger inside me and that came out at times that were not particularly advantageous to me career- wise. Another night, I dreamed I saw my father sweeping out the barn floor clean, and would not suffer the wheat to be brought in the barn. He appeared to me to be in anger.  Us investigators who went out into the field were faced on occasion with a lot of anger, by people saying why has it taken you five or six year to come and see me? I like people and get along, and I\\'m afraid to express my anger and my rage. I was shocked at the anger toward me. My anger with the US was not at first, that they had used that weapon - although that anger came later. A little anger is a good thing if it isn\\'t on your own behalf, if it\\'s for others deserving of your anger, your empathy. The anger that Uncle Junior has comes from my background. My father was the son of an Italian immigrant, and I\\'ve seen the fire of the Italian temperament. It can be explosive sometimes in ways that are both funny and tragic. The quickest way to defuse fear or insecurity or anger is usually humor. I think comics figure that out quickly, and, once you figure it out, you think, \\'Hey, if I can do this and get paid, that would be kind of cool.\\' I may have been the only candidate in America who failed to ride the wave of anti- establishment anger to victory. The preparation, commitment and desire to win will be no less than the last time I drove a grand prix car in anger. There\\'s no anger ever in a spiritual. There\\'s always the dream of a hope of a better day coming. That God understands the troubles that I\\'m experiencing. I want to express myself to feel that what I feel is real. My joy, my pain, my anger. It absolutely helped - to write the father in both \\'Juicy\\' and \\'Beasts,\\' I had to see the whole story from his point of view. All of a sudden I understood more of what my own father must be going through - the fear, the frustration, the anger... the hope that he\\'ll leave a legacy. \\x0cWhoever incites anger has a strong insurance against indifference. I think a certain amount of anger has been a fuel of mine, if you want - but also some sort of sadness, and plain mischief, of course. The reason why I love people, and writing about them, is because they don\\'t always respond with hate and anger. If they did I wouldn\\'t have a story to tell. Who wants to know about someone who was brutalised and became brutal? I\\'m interested in the exceptions. You can survive with anger, but you can\\'t live with it forever. The nice thing about anger is that, as an emotion, it\\'s strong enough to unplug me from the comedian\\'s mind for a minute and just be a frustrated member of the citizenry. I think people should be angry at things that are worthy of anger. Injustice is outrageous and deserves outrage. Successful prime-time television of any genre produces some kind of emotional reaction in the viewers. There are a lot of different emotions to tap into. The emotion of the reward of discovery, the feeling of righteous anger, the feelings of pathos and sadness, or sentimentality of being moved by something. My character had been in the chair for seven years. He had gone through his anger, depression, drug and alcohol abuse. He had gone through everything, now he was up, he was happy, he was filled with his dream. I realised one day that men are emotional cripples. We can\\'t express ourselves emotionally, we can only do it with anger and humour. Emotional stability and expression comes from women. My hope is that out of all the anger and seeming hostility that we hear in some of today\\'s music will come some sort of coalition that will become politically involved. I\\'m not angry, I\\'m not an angry person, but I do sometimes like playing with the perception of anger, as in pretending that I\\'m more angry than I actually am, and sometimes it works quite well. \\x0cWith Stacy, it was interesting because you know he was within all this chaos, all these different lives that were so broken and so much anger and so much frustration and their skating came out of that, their different styles came out of that. I use the music to vent, and a lot of the stuff that I am writing about or was writing about contained a lot of anger and anxiety, stress and depression, so that\\'s how the album came out so dark. I don\\'t think I could play a character that I couldn\\'t relate to somehow. I\\'m not unfamiliar with frustration, anger, shame, helplessness and a load of other emotions that make up our psycho-soup. I try to focus on that frustration, that sense of unfairness, and multiply it. I\\'m really busted up over this and I\\'m very, very sorry to those people in the audience, the blacks, the Hispanics, whites - everyone that was there that took the brunt of that anger and hate and rage and how it came through. The anger that appears to be building up between the sexes becomes more virulent with every day that passes. And far from women taking the blame... the fact is that men are invariably portrayed as the bad guys. Being a good man is like being a good Nazi. For a long time I thought I could deal with my anger and hostility on my own. But I couldn\\'t. I denied that it had affected me, and yet I was so frantic on the inside with other people: I needed to be constantly reassured. The poor monkey, quietly seated on the ground, seemed to be in sore trouble at this display of anger. It is only with burning anger that we can speak of this attack by counter- revolutionary reactionary elements against the capital of our country, against our people\\'s democratic order and the power of the working class. The anger in the Brigade against those who fought the Republic in the rear was sharpened by reports of weapons, even tanks, being kept from the front and hidden for treacherous purposes. \\x0cIn the final analysis, the incident is seen as originating from an emotional expression of the frustration and anger of the proud people of China who had been subject to ever increasing oppression from without and decadent corruption from within. Our humor turns our anger into a fine art. Anger is implanted in us as sort of sting, to make us gnash with our teeth against the devil, to make us vehement against him, not to set us in array against each other. When anger rushes unrestrained to action, like a hot steed, it stumbles on its way. The man of thought strikes deepest and strikes safely. I think that all the anger and cynicism comes from suppressing things that we always wanted. There is not in nature, a thing that makes man so deformed, so beastly, as doth intemperate anger. In the heat of our campaigns, we have all become accustomed to a little anger and exaggeration. Yet, on the whole, our political process has served us well. I don\\'t have the feeling of being motivated by anger, revenge or frustration. Anger is seldom without argument but seldom with a good one. As a system of philosophy it is not like the Tower of Babel, so daring its high aim as to seek a shelter against God\\'s anger but it is like a pyramid poised on its apex. Anger becomes limiting, restricting. You can\\'t see through it. While anger is there, look at that, too. But after a while, you have to look at something else. I love each and every one of you but, like my own family, you thrill, you frustrate, you anger. More marriages might survive if the partners realized that sometimes the better comes after the worse. We are not the same persons this year as last nor are those we love. It is a happy chance if we, changing, continue to love a changed person. There is no more lovely, friendly and charming relationship, communion or company than a good marriage. \\x0cMarriage is the most natural state of man, and... the state in which you will find solid happiness. Marriage is an alliance entered into by a man who can\\'t sleep with the window shut, and a woman who can\\'t sleep with the window open. Experts on romance say for a happy marriage there has to be more than a passionate love. For a lasting union, they insist, there must be a genuine liking for each other. Which, in my book, is a good definition for friendship. The heart of marriage is memories and if the two of you happen to have the same ones and can savor your reruns, then your marriage is a gift from the gods. Mom and Dad were married 64 years. And if you wondered what their secret was, you could have asked the local florist - because every day Dad gave Mom a rose, which he put on her bedside table. That\\'s how she found out what happened on the day my father died - she went looking for him because that morning, there was no rose. Strike an average between what a woman thinks of her husband a month before she marries him and what she thinks of him a year afterward, and you will have the truth about him. Marriage is an act of will that signifies and involves a mutual gift, which unites the spouses and binds them to their eventual souls, with whom they make up a sole family - a domestic church. A wedding anniversary is the celebration of love, trust, partnership, tolerance and tenacity. The order varies for any given year. The secret of a happy marriage is finding the right person. You know they\\'re right if you love to be with them all the time. You will reciprocally promise love, loyalty and matrimonial honesty. We only want for you this day that these words constitute the principle of your entire life and that with the help of divine grace you will observe these solemn vows that today, before God, you formulate. Some people ask the secret of our long marriage. We take time to go to a restaurant two times a week. A little candlelight, dinner, soft music and dancing. She goes Tuesdays, I go Fridays. \\x0cWhy does a woman work ten years to change a man\\'s habits and then complain that he\\'s not the man she married? The concept of two people living together for 25 years without a serious dispute suggests a lack of spirit only to be admired in sheep. One should believe in marriage as in the immortality of the soul. A lot of good love can happen in ten years. Chains do not hold a marriage together. It is threads, hundreds of tiny threads, which sew people together through the years. Under this window in stormy weather I marry this man and woman together Let none but Him who rules the thunder Put this man and woman asunder. The bonds of matrimony are like any other bonds - they mature slowly. I\\'ve been in love with the same woman for forty-one years. If my wife finds out, she\\'ll kill me. Never tell a secret to a bride or a groom wait until they have been married longer. I think you have to be willing to take a bullet for somebody if you\\'re going to stand up there, take your vows, and be married to them for the rest of your life. If you love somebody, you love them. My parents had a 25-year age gap between them and my mum was the breadwinner, my dad the house husband. I\\'m a strong believer that a good relationship can work, whatever the situation. Married people from my generation are like an endangered species! That there\\'s no more important decision in life than who you marry. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. You marry somebody you love everything about them. You grow to learn about them. You never learn everything. Love is not weakness. It is strong. Only the sacrament of marriage can contain it. My mother and stepfather were married 43 years, so I have watched a long marriage. I feel like I had a very good role model for that. And, you know, it\\'s just a number. \\x0cLove grows more tremendously full, swift, poignant, as the years multiply. Each year on the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.\\'s birth, America has the opportunity to reflect on our nation\\'s progress towards the realization of his dream. So I think you have to marry for the right reasons, and marry the right person. Next month, I will celebrate my 30th anniversary of marriage with my beautiful bride, Vicki. Our marriage has been a blessing. I have gained even more respect for the institution over the past 3 decades and will defend it against attack. But to sustain a marriage for 50 years, you have to get real a little bit and find someone who is understanding and who you can grow with. My mom always says, \\'Marry the man who loves you a millimeter more.\\' We had a relationship that lasted 44 years. Herbert and I lived together 10 years before we were married. He always gave me a little heart for whatever anniversary. The day before the anniversary of D-Day, we lost a man who was equaled by few and surpassed by none as a leader in the cause of freedom: Ronald Reagan. Last week, the House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring the victims and heroes of September 11th. As we commemorate the anniversary of 9-11, we must also remember that the threat is still very real today. Since I wrote to you last we have got our chapel beautifully lighted with gas and have had our anniversary. So while an incredible amount of progress has been made, on this fifth anniversary, I wanted to come here and tell the people of this city directly: My administration is going to stand with you - and fight alongside you - until the job is done. Until New Orleans is all the way back, all the way. I\\'ve been sober for two-and-a- half years, My children are happy. In August, my wife and I will celebrate our fifteenth wedding anniversary. My band is back together with a sold-out tour. \\x0cI have for some time urged that a nuclear abolition summit to mark the effective end of the nuclear era be convened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the 70th anniversary of the bombings of those cities, with the participation of national leaders and representatives of global civil society. And this year is going to be the 25th anniversary of the 17-0 team, the only undefeated season. The London games mark the 24th anniversary of my winning two golds and setting the world record in the heptathlon. Someone is going to want it records are made to be broken - it\\'s only a matter of time. I hope mine will outlive me. We can\\'t forget what happened on May 4th, 1970, when four students gave up their lives because they had the American constitutional right of peaceful protest. They gave up their lives. And to sing that song in that spot on that anniversary was very emotional for us. See, the \\'On the Road\\' that came out in 1957 was censored. A lot of the honesty of it, the bitter honesty, is in the original scroll version that came out in 2007 on the 50- year anniversary. Back then, there was so much post- Second World War fear that was imposed on everybody - \\'You must live life this way\\' - and these guys were bored. The chances of a reunion now are less likely. I was thinking of having a 40th anniversary of the band, but now they are really another band, so it\\'s all a bit weird. On this important anniversary, we must remember that while we have come a long way in eliminating barriers, critical work remains to ensure all Americans can live up to their full potential. And currently, there are four to five new works in the pipeline for upcoming celebrations such as the Sydney 2000 Olympics, Australian Federation, my 50th Birthday, and Sydney Dance Company\\'s 25th Anniversary. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Peace Corps as it reached its 45th anniversary on March 1, 2006. Perhaps a hundred people assembled one evening, May 15, 1876, at the time when the country was celebrating the hundredth anniversary of its political independence. \\x0cPresently, the Commission for Commemorating 350 Years of American Jewish History has been brought about to encourage and sponsor a variety of historical activities that advance our understanding of the American Jewish experience as it marks this milestone anniversary. I am so excited this year getting to play the 85th Anniversary Macy\\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Everyone knows on Thanksgiving morning to get up, turn on the TV and watch the parade, so to be an actual participant is going to be fun and I\\'m looking forward to it. I am gonna have to put on my deer hunting gear, though, to stay warm! I was always very grateful to \\'em and am grateful to \\'em now. I went back a couple of years ago and did their 20th anniversary show. But the longer I stayed on Hee Haw, the worse things got for me musically. June 2005 is the five year anniversary of the debut of Battle Pope. It is a matter of public shame that while we have now commemorated our hundredth anniversary, not one in every ten children attending Public schools throughout the colonies is acquainted with a single historical fact about Australia. As the third anniversary of the September 11th attacks draws near we must ensure our nation is prepared to handle the continued threat of violence and terrorism on our country. This anniversary serves to help remind the American people that, in the wake of one of the greatest political scandals and misuse of power in our history as a nation, scandal produced important reforms that served this nation well for two decades. I didn\\'t make my first solo record until 1981 so I don\\'t have any 60\\'s or 70\\'s recordings but I am working on a large boxed set called DUST to be released next year, the 20th anniversary of my first solo record. Actually, the year anniversary of what you just heard, my son Grahame and I are going to be in a play together, and I\\'m acting for the first time in front of an audience that doesn\\'t consist of a high school drama class. \\x0cThis year, as we celebrate the 230th anniversary of America\\'s independence, please remember the symbols that are sacred to this country. Fly Old Glory high and show your respect and admiration for this great nation and the values we hold dear. On July 18, we will mark the 12th anniversary of the senseless loss of 85 lives in the bombing of the Jewish Cultural Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I did that Dior Couture 60th anniversary show in July. It took so long to get ready, I think I would have rather been watching. I feel there should have been some recognition of the Spice Girls at this year\\'s 25th anniversary. We flew the flag for Britain around the globe in the 1990s and we achieved a hell of a lot. It was very hard for all of us. It\\'s still very hard. The anniversary of his death just passed, and every single one of his friends, still, after all these years... it\\'s unbelievable. My last trip to New Orleans was for the fifth anniversary of Katrina, and I had the awesome opportunity to bring my family down. We all worked on a house together and met some of the families. 1 month ago the American people stopped to remember the third anniversary of the beginning of the Iraq war. We thought first and foremost of the selflessness, patriotism and heroism by our troops, our National Guard and Reserves. Both the Obama and Romney campaigns said they pulled all their political ads today in observance of the September 11th anniversary. But politics wasn\\'t very far offstage. The Obama campaign sees foreign policy as an advantage this year. The 150th anniversary of Penn State will highlight what is important and good about this distinguished institution and the fine people and research that it produces. We shape our buildings thereafter they shape us. Whatever good things we build end up building us. I don\\'t build in order to have clients. I have clients in order to build. A building has integrity just like a man. And just as seldom. \\x0cEvery great architect is - necessarily - a great poet. He must be a great original interpreter of his time, his day, his age. We require from buildings two kinds of goodness: first, the doing their practical duty well: then that they be graceful and pleasing in doing it. An architect\\'s most useful tools are an eraser at the drafting board, and a wrecking bar at the site. Light, God\\'s eldest daughter, is a principal beauty in a building. Architecture should speak of its time and place, but yearn for timelessness. Less is more. I don\\'t divide architecture, landscape and gardening to me they are one. Architecture is the art of how to waste space. My passion and great enjoyment for architecture, and the reason the older I get the more I enjoy it, is because I believe we - architects - can effect the quality of life of the people. Building art is a synthesis of life in materialised form. We should try to bring in under the same hat not a splintered way of thinking, but all in harmony together. The higher the building the lower the morals. A house is a machine for living in. A great building must begin with the unmeasurable, must go through measurable means when it is being designed and in the end must be unmeasurable. Those who look for the laws of Nature as a support for their new works collaborate with the creator. Architecture is basically a container of something. I hope they will enjoy not so much the teacup, but the tea. Architecture is the learned game, correct and magnificent, of forms assembled in the light. I believe that the way people live can be directed a little by architecture. Space has always been the spiritual dimension of architecture. It is not the physical statement of the structure so much as what it contains that moves us. Great buildings that move the spirit have always been rare. In every case they are unique, poetic, products of the heart. Architecture starts when you carefully put two bricks together. There it begins. \\x0cI try to give people a different way of looking at their surroundings. That\\'s art to me. Architecture is the reaching out for the truth. We should concentrate our work not only to a separated housing problem but housing involved in our daily work and all the other functions of the city. Make big plans aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will not die. Architecture arouses sentiments in man. The architect\\'s task therefore, is to make those sentiments more precise. To provide meaningful architecture is not to parody history but to articulate it. To me, a building - if it\\'s beautiful - is the love of one man, he\\'s made it out of his love for space, materials, things like that. Form follows profit is the aesthetic principle of our times. Warmth isn\\'t what minimalists are thought to have. But the building\\'s identity resided in the ornament. It is not the beauty of a building you should look at its the construction of the foundation that will stand the test of time. I hate vacations. If you can build buildings, why sit on the beach? A city building, you experience when you walk a suburban building, you experience when you drive. Every building is a prototype. No two are alike. The loftier the building, the deeper must the foundation be laid. I love building spaces: architecture, furniture, all of it, probably more than fashion. The development procedure is more tactile. It\\'s about space and form and it\\'s something you can share with other people. Architecture is a visual art, and the buildings speak for themselves. We build buildings which are terribly restless. And buildings don\\'t go anywhere. They shouldn\\'t be restless. Architecture tends to consume everything else, it has become one\\'s entire life. What people want, above all, is order. The interior of the house personifies the private world the exterior of it is part of the outside world. \\x0cIf you give people nothingness, they can ponder what can be achieved from that nothingness. Nothing requires the architect\\'s care more than the due proportions of buildings. Proportions are what makes the old Greek temples classic in their beauty. They are like huge blocks, from which the air has been literally hewn out between the columns. Architecture is not an inspirational business, it\\'s a rational procedure to do sensible and hopefully beautiful things that\\'s all. Not many architects have the luxury to reject significant things. Cities are the greatest creations of humanity. No architect troubled to design houses that suited people who were to live in them, because that would have meant building a whole range of different houses. It was far cheaper and, above all, timesaving to make them identical. If I have a style, I am not aware of it. Don\\'t clap too hard - it\\'s a very old building. Form follows function. The work of art shows people new directions and thinks of the future. The house thinks of the present. My buildings don\\'t speak in words but by means of their own spaciousness.  Designed by architects with honorable intentions but hands of palsy. The dialogue between client and architect is about as intimate as any conversation you can have, because when you\\'re talking about building a house, you\\'re talking about dreams. The Romans were not inventors of the supporting arch, but its extended use in vaults and intersecting barrel shapes and domes is theirs. The bungalow had more to do with how Americans live today than any other building that has gone remotely by the name of architecture in our history. Color in certain places has the great value of making the outlines and structural planes seem more energetic. In any architecture, there is an equity between the pragmatic function and the symbolic function. \\x0cAt a certain point, I just put the building and the art impulse together. I decided that building was a legitimate way to make sculpture. For many years, I have lived uncomfortably with the belief that most planning and architectural design suffers for lack of real and basic purpose. The ultimate purpose, it seems to me, must be the improvement of mankind. The frightening thought that what you draw may become a building makes for reasoned lines. Buildings should serve people, not the other way around. Architects in the past have tended to concentrate their attention on the building as a static object. I believe dynamics are more important: the dynamics of people, their interaction with spaces and environmental condition. My buildings will be my legacy... they will speak for me long after I\\'m gone. In Los Angeles, by the time you\\'re 35, you\\'re older than most of the buildings. Rome has not seen a modern building in more than half a century. It is a city frozen in time. Even at the United Nations, where legend has it that the building was designed so that there could be no corner offices, the expanse of glass in individual offices is said to be a dead giveaway as to rank. Five windows are excellent, one window not so great.  I have designed the most buildings of any living American architect. I am but an architectural composer. As a designer, the mission with which we have been charged is simple: providing space at the right cost. They can do without architecture who have no olives nor wines in the cellar. I call architecture frozen music. Fashion is architecture: it is a matter of proportions. The greatest advances of civilization, whether in architecture or painting, in science and literature, in industry or agriculture, have never come from centralized government. \\x0cI paint mostly from real life. It has to start with that. Real people, real street scenes, behind the curtain scenes, live models, paintings, photographs, staged setups, architecture, grids, graphic design. Whatever it takes to make it work. Prose is architecture, not interior decoration, and the Baroque is over. Switzerland is a small, steep country, much more up and down than sideways, and is all stuck over with large brown hotels built on the cuckoo clock style of architecture. The ancient Romans built their greatest masterpieces of architecture, their amphitheaters, for wild beasts to fight in. Architecture has recorded the great ideas of the human race. Not only every religious symbol, but every human thought has its page in that vast book. There are no rules of architecture for a castle in the clouds. All architecture is great architecture after sunset perhaps architecture is really a nocturnal art, like the art of fireworks. Every man\\'s work, whether it be literature, or music or pictures or architecture or anything else, is always a portrait of himself. I was planning to go into architecture. But when I arrived, architecture was filled up. Acting was right next to it, so I signed up for acting instead. Talking about music is like dancing about architecture. Architecture begins where engineering ends. The mother art is architecture. Without an architecture of our own we have no soul of our own civilization. The terrifying and edible beauty of Art Nouveau architecture. It is impossible, as impossible as to raise the dead, to restore anything that has ever been great or beautiful in architecture. That which I have insisted upon as the life of the whole, that spirit which is given only by the hand and eye of the workman, can never be recalled. A man of eighty has outlived probably three new schools of painting, two of architecture and poetry and a hundred in dress. No architecture is so haughty as that which is simple. \\x0cIt seems a fantastic paradox, but it is nevertheless a most important truth, that no architecture can be truly noble which is not imperfect. Organic architecture seeks superior sense of use and a finer sense of comfort, expressed in organic simplicity. Convinced as I am and as I am from my government that the world needs a new moral architecture over all I believe that this should be the first topic to debate in our world of today, ethics, moral. Maybe we can show government how to operate better as a result of better architecture. Eventually, I think Chicago will be the most beautiful great city left in the world. Noble life demands a noble architecture for noble uses of noble men. Lack of culture means what it has always meant: ignoble civilization and therefore imminent downfall. Architecture is the will of an epoch translated into space. All the revision in the world will not save a bad first draft: for the architecture of the thing comes, or fails to come, in the first conception, and revision only affects the detail and ornament, alas! All architecture is shelter, all great architecture is the design of space that contains, cuddles, exalts, or stimulates the persons in that space. Even though I build buildings and I pursue my architecture, I pursue it as an artist. I deliberately keep a tiny studio. I don\\'t want to be an architectural firm. I want to remain an artist. Engineering, medicine, business, architecture and painting are concerned not with the necessary but with the contingent - not with how things are but with how they might be - in short, with design. Poetry is not only dream and vision it is the skeleton architecture of our lives. It lays the foundations for a future of change, a bridge across our fears of what has never been before. The art of dancing stands at the source of all the arts that express themselves first in the human person. The art of building, or architecture, is the beginning of all the arts that lie outside the person and in the end they unite. All real education is the architecture of the soul. \\x0cNothing is as dangerous in architecture as dealing with separated problems. If we split life into separated problems we split the possibilities to make good building art. The details are the very source of expression in architecture. But we are caught in a vice between art and the bottom line. Architecture theory is very interesting. Today\\'s developer is a poor substitute for the committed entrepreneur of the last century for whom the work of architecture represented a chance to celebrate the worth of his enterprise. Rationalism is the enemy of art, though necessary as a basis for architecture. When you look at Japanese traditional architecture, you have to look at Japanese culture and its relationship with nature. You can actually live in a harmonious, close contact with nature - this very unique to Japan. I would have liked maybe to be in architecture or painting, something connected to the fine arts. The principle of the Gothic architecture is infinity made imaginable. Consider the momentous event in architecture when the wall parted and the column became. Architecture and building is about how you get around the obstacles that are presented to you. That sometimes determines how successful you\\'ll be: How good are you at going around obstacles? I could have been an architect, but I don\\'t think I\\'d have been very happy. Nearly all modern architecture is a silly game as far as I can see. I see music as fluid architecture. Architecture doesn\\'t come from theory. You don\\'t think your way through a building. Does an architecture to assuage the spirit have a place? The new architecture of transparency and lightness comes from Japan and Europe. The way of architecture is the quiet voice that underlies it and has guided it from the beginning. Vitality is radiated from exceptional art and architecture. \\x0cWe are stymied by regulations, limited choice and the threat of litigation. Neither consultants nor industry itself provide research which takes architecture forward. To work in architecture you are so much involved with society, with politics, with bureaucrats. It\\'s a very complicated process to do large projects. You start to see the society, how it functions, how it works. Then you have a lot of criticism about how it works. If architecture is frozen music then music must be liquid architecture. To create architecture is to put in order. Put what in order? Function and objects. I probably spent the first 20 years of my life wanting to be as American as possible. Through my 20s, and into my 30s, I began to become aware of how so much of my art and architecture has a decidedly Eastern character. I left science, then I went into art, but I approach things very analytically. I choose to pursue both art and architecture as completely separate fields rather than merging them. The process I go through in the art and the architecture, I actually want it to be almost childlike. Sometimes I think it\\'s magical. In art or architecture your project is only done when you say it\\'s done. If you want to rip it apart at the eleventh hour and start all over again, you never finish. I was one of those crazy creatures. I loved logic, math, computer programming. I loved systems and logic approaches. And so I just figured architecture is this perfect combination. Art is very tricky because it\\'s what you do for yourself. It\\'s much harder for me to make those works than the monuments or the architecture. In my early 20s I was so miserable doing construction, I wanted something that paid money. I liked nice stuff. I liked cars and architecture, and things that cost money. I wanted to not swing a hammer, and make money... and not do stuff that was dirty. I attempted to get into comedy. I started to do stand- up, but I wasn\\'t very good at it. I\\'m drawn to furniture design as complete architecture on a minor scale. \\x0cThe British political system and the whole clapped out Westminster architecture, and the language that we use about politics, it\\'s completely unsustainable. You either decide to be part of that transition to do something different. Or you cling to old certainties. I got into this little habit of architecture and building. I designed a house in Colorado and one in Hawaii. The idea is supposed to be build and sell - but then I can never bring myself to sell them. The only job that was ever of interest to me other than filmmaking is architecture. I would like my architecture to inspire people to use their own resources, to move into the future. Any architectural project we do takes at least four or five years, so increasingly there is a discrepancy between the acceleration of culture and the continuing slowness of architecture. Architecture, of all the arts, is the one which acts the most slowly, but the most surely, on the soul. In architecture the idea degenerated. Design allows a more direct and pleasurable route. Post-Modernism was a reaction against Modernism. It came quite early to music and literature, and a little later to architecture. And I think it\\'s still coming to computer science. Liquid architecture. It\\'s like jazz - you improvise, you work together, you play off each other, you make something, they make something. And I think it\\'s a way of - for me, it\\'s a way of trying to understand the city, and what might happen in the city. I see the Beijing National Stadium as an architectural project. I accepted Herzog and De Meuron\\'s invitation to collaborate on the design, and our proposal won the competition. From beginning to end, I stayed with the project. I am committed to fostering relationships between a city and its architecture. The building of the architecture of a novel - the craft of it - is something I never tire of. I strive for an architecture from which nothing can be taken away. \\x0cIt\\'s my goal to make a building as immaterial as possible. Architecture is a very material thing. It takes a lot of resources, so why not eliminate what you don\\'t need as long as you\\'re able to achieve the same result? The American attitude towards efficiency and execution should always underlie architecture. The architecture profession has lost a lot of its integrity, especially in the USA. The general architect here has no scruples, no ambitions. I\\'d like to do a lot of things - whether in design or architecture or business. So what we have tried to do in our later buildings is to try to be completely consistent, as a painter is consistent or as a sculptor is consistent. Architecture also must be very consistent. Japanese architecture is very much copied in this country and in Europe. If you examine this, I think that you will find that it\\'s the mechanics of Japanese architecture that have been thought of as the direct influence upon our architecture. If a building becomes architecture, then it is art. Victorian architecture in the United States was copied straight from England. The logic of Palladian architecture presented an aesthetic formula which could be applied universally. The English light is so very subtle, so very soft and misty, that the architecture responded with great delicacy of detail. The Egyptian contribution to architecture was more concerned with remembering the dead than the living. Of all the lessons most relevant to architecture today, Japanese flexibility is the greatest. Georgian architecture respected the scale of both the individual and the community. French architecture always manages to combine the most magnificent underlying themes of architecture like Roman design, it looks to the community. Japanese traditional architecture is created based on these conditions. This is the reason you have a very high degree of connection between the outside and inside in architecture. \\x0cThe speed of change makes you wonder what will become of architecture. Without this spirit, Modernist architecture cannot fully exist. Since there is often a mismatch between the logic and the spirit of Modernism, I use architecture to reconcile the two. Italy is full of historical buildings. And Europe holds a great history of philosophy from Greece until today. I read all those books and see these buildings, and I think of where I stand when I design my architecture. All those involved in the construction of an architectural design, from the architect to the builder, have an attachment to the architecture, although it\\'s difficult to quantify the attachment. Japanese architecture is traditionally based on wooden structures that need renovating on a regular basis. Spiritual space is lost in gaining convenience. I saw the need to create a mixture of Japanese spiritual culture and modern western architecture. People can inhabit anything. And they can be miserable in anything and ecstatic in anything. More and more I think that architecture has nothing to do with it. Of course, that\\'s both liberating and alarming. Until the Eighties, Oslo was a rather boring town, but it\\'s changed a lot, and is now much more cosmopolitan. If I go downtown, I visit the harbour to see the tall ships and the ferries, and to admire the modern architecture such as the Opera House or the new Astrup Fearnley Museum on the water\\'s edge. Every time a student walks past a really urgent, expressive piece of architecture that belongs to his college, it can help reassure him that he does have that mind, does have that soul. I believe very strongly, and have fought since many years ago - at least over 30 years ago - to get architecture not just within schools, but architecture talked about under history, geography, science, technology, art. My house is my refuge, an emotional piece of architecture, not a cold piece of convenience. \\x0cWe all love musical architecture there\\'s no doubt about that. Architecture in general is frozen music. Painting, sculpture and architecture are finished, but the art habit continues. Bridges are perhaps the most invisible form of public architecture. Look, architecture has a lot of places to hide behind, a lot of excuses. \\'The client made me do this.\\' \\'The city made me do this.\\' \\'Oh, the budget.\\' I don\\'t believe that anymore. In fact, it will be very easy to climb the building because of its shape and architecture. Charles was very intent to use his years as Prince of Wales to make his mark while he still had freedom of maneuver that he wouldn\\'t have as King. The first subject he really went for was architecture. It made an impact. It was the drawing that led me to architecture, the search for light and astonishing forms. I search for surprise in my architecture. A work of art should cause the emotion of newness. Trying to describe something musical is like dancing to architecture, it\\'s really difficult. Of the individual poems, some are more lyric and some are more descriptive or narrative. Each poem is fixed in a moment. All those moments written or read together take on the movement and architecture of a narrative. I don\\'t know why I\\'ve always been so captivated by architecture. The two elements the traveler first captures in the big city are extra human architecture and furious rhythm. Geometry and anguish. But I absolutely believe that architecture is a social activity that has to do with some sort of communication or places of interaction, and that to change the environment is to change behaviour. Architecture is inhabited sculpture. And when an architect has designed a house with large windows, which is a necessity today in order to pull the daylight into these very deep houses, then curtains come to play a big role in architecture. I don\\'t see that any buildings should be excluded from the term architecture, as long as they are done properly. \\x0cIf architecture had nothing to do with art, it would be astonishingly easy to build houses, but the architect\\'s task - his most difficult task - is always that of selecting. In addressing a task, one almost always has several possible options, sometimes only a few, and they may all be practical and functional. But they lack the aesthetic aspect that raises it to architecture. If architecture is, as is sometimes said, music set in concrete, then football and basketball may be said to be creativity embodied in team sports. The architecture of a story can be a little bit different if it\\'s a true story. Chicago is known for good steaks, expensive stores and beautiful architecture. Unfortunately, the Windy City also enjoys a reputation for corrupt politics, violent crime, and some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere in the country. We think of enterprise architecture as the process we use for fully describing and mapping business functionality and business requirements and relating them to information systems requirements. Escape from the architecture ghetto is one of the major drivers and has been from the very beginning. The intellectual force of the West is still dominant, but other cultures are getting stronger. I expect that we will develop a new way of thinking in architecture and urban planning, and that less will be based on our models. People kind of tend to mystify design and architecture by suggesting you need to train. I mean, certainly writing, painting, photography, dance, architecture, there is an aspect of almost every art form that is useful and that merges into film in some way. I could be happy doing something like architecture. It would involve another couple of years of graduate school, but that\\'s what I studied in college. That\\'s what I always wanted to do. My interest in architecture has always been sculptural. Most of my photography is of architecture. \\x0cArchitecture is a science arising out of many other sciences, and adorned with much and varied learning by the help of which a judgment is formed of those works which are the result of other arts. Of course I know very little about architecture, and the older I get the less I know. Architecture is about public space held by buildings. Architecture is a slow business, and city planning even slower. I don\\'t find Hollywood interesting, so I\\'m thinking of studying architecture instead. Architecture is a art when one consciously or unconsciously creates aesthetic emotion in the atmosphere and when this environment produces well being. Every one who has a heart, however ignorant of architecture he may be, feels the transcendent beauty and poetry of the mediaeval churches. Yet for my part, deeply as I am moved by the religious architecture of the Middle Ages, I cannot honestly say that I ever felt the slightest emotion in any modern Gothic church. Winning a competition in architecture is a ticket to oblivion. It\\'s just an idea. Ninety-nine per cent never get built. I studied architecture in New York. So, really I was very moved, like everyone else, to try to contribute something that has that resonance and profundity of it means to all of us. Writing about music is like dancing about architecture. When I\\'m in London, Claridge\\'s is a great favourite. I\\'m a big fan of art deco architecture and the rooms are extraordinary. I take a lot from everywhere. I take from music, architecture, novels, and plays. Anywhere that hits you. I\\'ve never owned an Apple product. I like the fact that PCs are open architecture and not locked down like Apple products. I feel that Macs are also unjustifiably overpriced. I\\'ve always liked traveling around Europe and seeing the architecture. The buildings in capital cities have been there for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years. Some look better than the new ones. \\x0cAt this present time, matter is still the best way to think of architecture, but I\\'m not so sure for very long. The computer is radicalizing the way we think about our world. If you\\'re into architecture and you\\'re from the West, everything is hors d\\'oeuvres for working to rebuild the Temple. Ultimately you\\'re led there. You can\\'t escape it. You can just drift unhappily towards this vision of heaven on earth, and ultimately that is what architecture is a vision of: Heaven on earth, at it\\'s best. The intellectual architecture means focusing on doing great work instead of focusing on agency politics. The team architecture means setting up an organization that helps people produce that great work in teams. One of my favorite vacation places is Miami, because of the people, the water and the beach - of course - and the architecture on Miami Beach is so wonderful. I would fix other people\\'s lines if they asked me on occasion. The hard part of writing is the architecture of it, getting the story and structuring it. Not the tweaking of lines. But those musics do not address the larger kind of architecture in time that classical music does, whatever each one of us knows that classical music must mean. I quit college. I was studying architecture for about a year. It is not with architecture that one can disseminate any political ideology. Architecture will always express the technical and social progress of the country in which it is carried out. If we wish to give it the human content that it lacks, we must participate in the political struggle. Architecture is my work, and I\\'ve spent my whole life at a drawing board, but life is more important than architecture. What matters is to improve human beings. Architecture is invention. When I write now I do not invent situation, characters, or actions, but rather structures and discursive forms, textual groupings which are combined according to secret affinities among themselves, as in architecture or the plastic arts. \\x0cThe organizational architecture is really that a centipede walks on hundred legs and one or two don\\'t count. So if I lose one or two legs, the process will go on, the organization will go on, the growth will go on. Does it follow that the house has nothing in common with art and is architecture not to be included in the arts? Only a very small part of architecture belongs to art: the tomb and the monument. Everything else that fulfils a function is to be excluded from the domain of art. Architecture is involved with the world, but at the same time it has a certain autonomy. This autonomy cannot be explained in terms of traditional logic because the most interesting parts of the work are non-verbal. They operate within the terms of the work, like any art. I\\'m often called an old- fashioned modernist. But the modernists had the absurd idea that architecture could heal the world. That\\'s impossible. And today nobody expects architects to have these grand visions any more. The aesthetic of architecture has to be rooted in a broader idea about human activities like walking, relaxing and communicating. Architecture thinks about how these activities can be given added value. You might say that when you step inside, you\\'re entering a honorific space, but that\\'s something totally different than experiencing it. And in architecture the experience comes first. That has the deepest effect on us. In my experience, if you have to keep the lavatory door shut by extending your left leg, it\\'s modern architecture. I love a lot of things, and I\\'m pretty much obsessive about most things I do, whether it be gardening, or architecture, or music. I\\'d be an obsessive hairdresser. Doctrines provide an architecture for both Republican and Democrat presidents to carry out policies. That Moorish architecture is all over the place, of course. It affects me everywhere I see it, as it does so many people. But Brand Library was a special place to me, and I know I\\'ve paid homage to it many times in my drawings. \\x0cInformation and inspiration are everywhere... history, art, architecture, everything an illustrator needs. Europe is, after all, the land that has generated most of the enduring myths and legends of Western culture. Once I got out of architecture school I decided not to be an architect, I just started my own little design studio. I went to school for engineering, I studied jazz. So I always had this kind of creative side and technical side, and I thought architecture might be the way to combine them, so I went to architecture school in New York. An important work of architecture will create polemics. The same sort of thing happened in my dispute with the National Trust book: Follies: A National Trust Guide, which implied that the only pleasure you can get from Folly architecture is by calling the architect mad, and by laughing at the architecture. I was a student at Columbia College, actually, in the Architecture school. Paul would drive in from Queens, showing me these new songs. I can\\'t remember us working it out. After about the first Millennium, Italy was the cradle of Romanesque architecture, which spread throughout Europe, much of it extending the structural daring with minimal visual elaboration. After World War II great strides were made in modern Japanese architecture, not only in advanced technology, allowing earthquake resistant tall buildings, but expressing and infusing characteristics of traditional Japanese architecture in modern buildings. The job of buildings is to improve human relations: architecture must ease them, not make them worse. But I feel truly wowed by the architecture and the meaning of the architecture if you get lost in it and think about the man hours in the smallest little chapel, and the love involved. God it\\'s fantastic. There was an age, however, when the transition from savagery to civilization, with all its impressive outward manifestations in art and architecture, took place for the first time. \\x0cI think that narrative, fiction filmmaking is the culmination of several art forms: theater, art history, architecture. Whereas doc filmmaking is more pure cinema, like cinema verite is film in its purest form. I was going to be an architect. I graduated with a degree in architecture and I had a scholarship to go back to Princeton and get my Masters in architecture. I\\'d done theatricals in college, but I\\'d done them because it was fun. But after the time there I\\'d had it with fashion again, so I left to go to architecture school in a summer course at Harvard, which didn\\'t last very long. Architecture can\\'t fully represent the chaos and turmoil that are part of the human personality, but you need to put some of that turmoil into the architecture, or it isn\\'t real. I would like to attend college in the future when I have time. I have always been interested in architecture, so perhaps I would pursue a degree in that or business. You look at the steamboat, the railroad, the car, the airplane - not all of these were invented in the Anglo- American world, but they were popularized and extended by it. They were made possible by the financial architecture, the capital intensive operations invented and developed by the Anglo- Americans. What\\'s fascinating about D.C., the exteriors are these elaborate structures, this gorgeous architecture and beautiful stonework, and then you go inside and it\\'s crap- looking - apart from the White House, which is beautiful. I acquired an admiration for Japanese culture, art, and architecture, and learned of the existence of the game of GO, which I still play. I would\\'ve been intrigued by being a film director. I would\\'ve been intrigued by politics. I thought about architecture. There is a lot of interest in the arts, music, theatre, filmmaking, engineering, architecture and software design. I think we have now transitioned the modern-day version of the entrepreneur into the creative economy. \\x0cI like things that are kind of eclectic, when one thing doesn\\'t go with another. That\\'s why I love Rome. The town itself is that way. It\\'s where Fascist architecture meets classic Renaissance, where the ancient bangs up against the contemporary. It has a touch of everything. That\\'s my style, and that\\'s what my work is about. I feel however, that we architects have a special duty and mission... (to contribute) to the socio-cultural development of architecture and urban planning. There is a powerful need for symbolism, and that means the architecture must have something that appeals to the human heart. There is a powerful need for symbolism, and that means the architecture must have something that appeals to the human heart.  Technological considerations are of great importance to architecture and cities in the informational society. Opera, next to Gothic architecture, is one of the strangest inventions of Western man. It could not have been foreseen by any logical process. I don\\'t believe in morality in architecture. I have no requirements for a style of architecture. I see architecture not as Gropius did, as a moral venture, as truth, but as invention, in the same way that poetry or music or painting is invention. The dialogue of architecture has been centered too long around the idea of truth. The rules of navigation never navigated a ship. The rules of architecture never built a house. Each new situation requires a new architecture. I like to play with architecture! It\\'s my favorite game. I think architecture has to be a gift. What is being called the UN \\'gender architecture\\' is more like a shack. Women need a bigger global house if equality is ever to become a reality. Architecture is politics. What has happened to architecture since the second world war that the only passers-by who can contemplate it without pain are those equipped with a white stick and a dog? \\x0cFirst, there is the bare beauty of the logs themselves with their long lines and firm curves. Then there is the open charm felt of the structural features which are not hidden under plaster and ornament, but are clearly revealed, a charm felt in Japanese architecture. Architecture aims at Eternity. Revived in this country the long forgotten beauties of Gothic architecture. Any work of architecture that has with it some discussion, some polemic, I think is good. It shows that people are interested, people are involved. There will never be great architects or great architecture without great patrons. The architecture of our future is not only unfinished the scaffolding has hardly gone up. True art is characterized by an irresistible urge in the creative artist. If you hear a voice within you say \\'you cannot paint,\\' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced. The highest art is always the most religious, and the greatest artist is always a devout person. The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance. A work of art is the unique result of a unique temperament. The purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls. No great artist ever sees things as they really are. If he did, he would cease to be an artist. Without tradition, art is a flock of sheep without a shepherd. Without innovation, it is a corpse. Every artist was first an amateur. The essence of all beautiful art, all great art, is gratitude. Art is the most intense mode of individualism that the world has known. Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time. In art, the hand can never execute anything higher than the heart can imagine. Life imitates art far more than art imitates Life. A guilty conscience needs to confess. A work of art is a confession. This world is but a canvas to our imagination. \\x0cAn artist is not paid for his labor but for his vision. Art is a step from what is obvious and well-known toward what is arcane and concealed. Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. A picture is worth a thousand words. If you do not breathe through writing, if you do not cry out in writing, or sing in writing, then don\\'t write, because our culture has no use for it. Pictures must not be too picturesque. Art is the only way to run away without leaving home. An artist is always alone - if he is an artist. No, what the artist needs is loneliness. We have art in order not to die of the truth. Art is the proper task of life. Without art, the crudeness of reality would make the world unbearable. Drawing is the honesty of the art. There is no possibility of cheating. It is either good or bad. Art is not a thing it is a way. You don\\'t take a photograph, you make it. Vision is the art of seeing what is invisible to others. A picture is a poem without words. Without freedom, no art art lives only on the restraints it imposes on itself, and dies of all others. The sculptor produces the beautiful statue by chipping away such parts of the marble block as are not needed - it is a process of elimination. I found I could say things with color and shapes that I couldn\\'t say any other way - things I had no words for. Every artist dips his brush in his own soul, and paints his own nature into his pictures. A man paints with his brains and not with his hands. An artist is somebody who produces things that people don\\'t need to have. The beginning is the most important part of the work. A good painting to me has always been like a friend. It keeps me company, comforts and inspires. The artist is a receptacle for emotions that come from all over the place: from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a passing shape, from a spider\\'s web. An artist cannot fail it is a success to be one. Personality is everything in art and poetry. \\x0cPainting, n.: The art of protecting flat surfaces from the weather, and exposing them to the critic. Art is a collaboration between God and the artist, and the less the artist does the better. Painting is easy when you don\\'t know how, but very difficult when you do. The essence of all art is to have pleasure in giving pleasure. Very few people possess true artistic ability. It is therefore both unseemly and unproductive to irritate the situation by making an effort. If you have a burning, restless urge to write or paint, simply eat something sweet and the feeling will pass. The mediator of the inexpressible is the work of art. Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot, others transform a yellow spot into the sun. In art as in love, instinct is enough. Every human is an artist. The dream of your life is to make beautiful art. Art, like morality, consists in drawing the line somewhere. In art the best is good enough. Lying in bed would be an altogether perfect and supreme experience if only one had a colored pencil long enough to draw on the ceiling. The very essence of the creative is its novelty, and hence we have no standard by which to judge it. I\\'m afraid that if you look at a thing long enough, it loses all of its meaning. Painting is just another way of keeping a diary. Ads are the cave art of the twentieth century. All art is but imitation of nature. An artist never really finishes his work, he merely abandons it. I don\\'t want to be interesting. I want to be good. The true work of art is but a shadow of the divine perfection. Art is not a study of positive reality, it is the seeking for ideal truth. Photograph: a picture painted by the sun without instruction in art. Even a true artist does not always produce art. An artist is a dreamer consenting to dream of the actual world. If we could but paint with the hand what we see with the eye. \\x0cPhotography takes an instant out of time, altering life by holding it still. To say that a work of art is good, but incomprehensible to the majority of men, is the same as saying of some kind of food that it is very good but that most people can\\'t eat it. Painting is an infinitely minute part of my personality. A writer should write with his eyes and a painter paint with his ears. I cry out for order and find it only in art. Fine art is that in which the hand, the head, and the heart of man go together. Art consists of limitation. The most beautiful part of every picture is the frame. The art of art, the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of letters, is simplicity. Not everybody trusts paintings but people believe photographs. Every production of an artist should be the expression of an adventure of his soul. There is nothing worse than a sharp image of a fuzzy concept. The arts are an even better barometer of what is happening in our world than the stock market or the debates in congress. Art is man\\'s expression of his joy in labor. Fashion is only the attempt to realize art in living forms and social intercourse. A great artist is always before his time or behind it. Artists who seek perfection in everything are those who cannot attain it in anything. Life is painting a picture, not doing a sum. Abstract art: a product of the untalented sold by the unprincipled to the utterly bewildered. The artist is nothing without the gift, but the gift is nothing without work. When I judge art, I take my painting and put it next to a God made object like a tree or flower. If it clashes, it is not art. Treat a work of art like a prince. Let it speak to you first. I have no fear of making changes, destroying the image, etc., because the painting has a life of its own. \\x0cArt produces ugly things which frequently become more beautiful with time. Fashion, on the other hand, produces beautiful things which always become ugly with time. The terrifying and edible beauty of Art Nouveau architecture. Art for art\\'s sake is a philosophy of the well-fed. Every good painter paints what he is. The history of art is the history of revivals. The business of art is to reveal the relation between man and his environment. So vast is art, so narrow human wit. To make us feel small in the right way is a function of art men can only make us feel small in the wrong way. Every creator painfully experiences the chasm between his inner vision and its ultimate expression. Trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle. Art begins with resistance - at the point where resistance is overcome. No human masterpiece has ever been created without great labor. To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event. Art is parasitic on life, just as criticism is parasitic on art. The waking mind is the least serviceable in the arts. Advertising is the greatest art form of the 20th century. My imagination can picture no fairer happiness than to continue living for art. Works of art, in my opinion, are the only objects in the material universe to possess internal order, and that is why, though I don\\'t believe that only art matters, I do believe in Art for Art\\'s sake. What art offers is space - a certain breathing room for the spirit. To send light into the darkness of men\\'s hearts - such is the duty of the artist. Pictures deface walls more often than they decorate them. I\\'ve been called many names like perfectionist, difficult and obsessive. I think it takes obsession, takes searching for the details for any artist to be good. Art is science made clear. Rules and models destroy genius and art. Immature artists imitate. Mature artists steal. \\x0cWhat makes photography a strange invention is that its primary raw materials are light and time. Art is magic delivered from the lie of being truth. All art is autobiographical. The pearl is the oyster\\'s autobiography. The task of art today is to bring chaos into order. Things are beautiful if you love them. I don\\'t paint things. I only paint the difference between things. The moment you cheat for the sake of beauty, you know you\\'re an artist. Art is the right hand of Nature. The latter has only given us being, the former has made us men. Of all lies, art is the least untrue. Art is either plagiarism or revolution. Lesser artists borrow, great artists steal. The artist belongs to his work, not the work to the artist. A sculptor is a person who is interested in the shape of things, a poet in words, a musician by sounds. Art is the daughter of freedom. Every artist writes his own autobiography. Great art picks up where nature ends. When I work, and in my art, I hold hands with God.  The perfection of art is to conceal art. My painting does not come from the easel. Art, in itself, is an attempt to bring order out of chaos. Drawing is like making an expressive gesture with the advantage of permanence. Art is a revolt against fate. All art is a revolt against man\\'s fate. Art is the stored honey of the human soul, gathered on wings of misery and travail. I don\\'t think there\\'s any artist of any value who doesn\\'t doubt what they\\'re doing. Time extracts various values from a painter\\'s work. When these values are exhausted the pictures are forgotten, and the more a picture has to give, the greater it is. Wherever art appears, life disappears. I\\'ve never really had a hobby, unless you count art, which the IRS once told me I had to declare as a hobby since I hadn\\'t made money with it. An artist is never ahead of his time but most people are far behind theirs. \\x0cThe beauty one can find in art is one of the pitifully few real and lasting products of human endeavor. The creative act lasts but a brief moment, a lightning instant of give-and-take, just long enough for you to level the camera and to trap the fleeting prey in your little box. I like to pretend that my art has nothing to do with me. I choose a block of marble and chop off whatever I don\\'t need. Rationalism is the enemy of art, though necessary as a basis for architecture. The artist one day falls through a hole in the brambles, and from that moment he is following the dark rapids of an underground river which may sometimes flow so near to the surface that the laughing picnic parties are heard above. Every other artist begins with a blank canvas, a piece of paper the photographer begins with the finished product. To make pictures big is to make them more powerful. My hand is the extension of the thinking process - the creative process. That\\'s the motivation of an artist - to seek attention of some kind. The principles of true art is not to portray, but to evoke. Art hurts. Art urges voyages - and it is easier to stay at home. I think about my work every minute of the day. Vitality is radiated from exceptional art and architecture. By the work one knows the workman. Art doesn\\'t transform. It just plain forms. My love of fine art increased - the more of it I saw, the more of it I wanted to see. Mournful and yet grand is the destiny of the artist. The artist\\'s world is limitless. It can be found anywhere, far from where he lives or a few feet away. It is always on his doorstep. Artists don\\'t make objects. Artists make mythologies. The principle of art is to pause, not bypass. Art is the unceasing effort to compete with the beauty of flowers - and never succeeding. The writer, when he is also an artist, is someone who admits what others don\\'t dare reveal. \\x0cThe works must be conceived with fire in the soul but executed with clinical coolness. Trying to force creativity is never good. Beauty in art is often nothing but ugliness subdued. When I think of art I think of beauty. Beauty is the mystery of life. It is not in the eye it is in the mind. In our minds there is awareness of perfection. Modern art is what happens when painters stop looking at girls and persuade themselves that they have a better idea. Vision is the true creative rhythm. No heirloom of humankind captures the past as do art and language. The history of modern art is also the history of the progressive loss of art\\'s audience. Art has increasingly become the concern of the artist and the bafflement of the public. In an artwork you\\'re always looking for artistic decisions, so an ashtray is perfect. An ashtray has got life and death. Art is an invention of aesthetics, which in turn is an invention of philosophers... What we call art is a game. The artist who aims at perfection in everything achieves it in nothing. I think an artist\\'s responsibility is more complex than people realize. Painting is by nature a luminous language. A painting that is well composed is half finished. Artists themselves are not confined, but their output is. When that shutter clicks, anything else that can be done afterward is not worth consideration. If a building becomes architecture, then it is art. Every time a student walks past a really urgent, expressive piece of architecture that belongs to his college, it can help reassure him that he does have that mind, does have that soul. Light in Nature creates the movement of colors. Art in Nature is rhythmic and has a horror of constraint. Murals in restaurants are on a par with the food in museums. It is a mistake for a sculptor or a painter to speak or write very often about his job. It releases tension needed for his work. \\x0cPhotography is a major force in explaining man to man. The more horrifying this world becomes, the more art becomes abstract. Art is subject to arbitrary fashion. When I make art, I think about its ability to connect with others, to bring them into the process. You begin with the possibilities of the material. To an engineer, good enough means perfect. With an artist, there\\'s no such thing as perfect. Culture is the arts elevated to a set of beliefs. I think of my peace paintings as one long poem, with each painting being a single stanza. It is art that makes life, makes interest, makes importance and I know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process. Art ought never to be considered except in its relations with its ideal beauty. Art is the desire of a man to express himself, to record the reactions of his personality to the world he lives in. I paint with shapes. I was the least Pop of all the Pop artists. I realize that protest paintings are not exactly in vogue, but I\\'ve done many. Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art... It has no survival value rather it is one of those things that give value to survival. The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge. All the art of living lies in a fine mingling of letting go and holding on. The art of acceptance is the art of making someone who has just done you a small favor wish that he might have done you a greater one. Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong remedies. Love of beauty is taste. The creation of beauty is art. Even in literature and art, no man who bothers about originality will ever be original: whereas if you simply try to tell the truth (without caring twopence how often it has been told before) you will, nine times out of ten, become original without ever having noticed it. \\x0cI regard the theatre as the greatest of all art forms, the most immediate way in which a human being can share with another the sense of what it is to be a human being. Be true to yourself, help others, make each day your masterpiece, make friendship a fine art, drink deeply from good books - especially the Bible, build a shelter against a rainy day, give thanks for your blessings and pray for guidance every day. Those who educate children well are more to be honored than they who produce them for these only gave them life, those the art of living well. Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit. The hours I spend with you I look upon as sort of a perfumed garden, a dim twilight, and a fountain singing to it. You and you alone make me feel that I am alive. Other men it is said have seen angels, but I have seen thee and thou art enough. Be slow to fall into friendship but when thou art in, continue firm and constant. Beautiful music is the art of the prophets that can calm the agitations of the soul it is one of the most magnificent and delightful presents God has given us. It is through art, and through art only, that we can realise our perfection. A fool\\'s brain digests philosophy into folly, science into superstition, and art into pedantry. Hence University education. All art is quite useless. I wash my hands of those who imagine chattering to be knowledge, silence to be ignorance, and affection to be art. There\\'s no art to find the mind\\'s construction in the face. The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook. The art of love is largely the art of persistence. The moment you think you understand a great work of art, it\\'s dead for you. If art is to nourish the roots of our culture, society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him. \\x0cIt is only an auctioneer who can equally and impartially admire all schools of art. What we have to do, what at any rate it is our duty to do, is to revive the old art of Lying. The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. A man\\'s work is nothing but this slow trek to rediscover, through the detours of art, those two or three great and simple images in whose presence his heart first opened. Speak the truth, do not yield to anger give, if thou art asked for little by these three steps thou wilt go near the gods. A work of art is above all an adventure of the mind. Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it. The art of acting consists in keeping people from coughing. In general, the art of government consists of taking as much money as possible from one class of citizens to give to another. Procrastination is the art of keeping up with yesterday. I think in art, but especially in films, people are trying to confirm their own existences. If being an egomaniac means I believe in what I do and in my art or music, then in that respect you can call me that... I believe in what I do, and I\\'ll say it. Life is the art of drawing without an eraser. Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and choice, is thought to aim at some good and for this reason the good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things aim. Diplomacy is the art of saying \\'Nice doggie\\' until you can find a rock. Well, Art is Art, isn\\'t it? Still, on the other hand, water is water. And east is east and west is west and if you take cranberries and stew them like applesauce they taste much more like prunes than rhubarb does. Now you tell me what you know. Admiration for a quality or an art can be so strong that it deters us from striving to possess it. Homer has taught all other poets the art of telling lies skillfully. \\x0cArt is not merely an imitation of the reality of nature, but in truth a metaphysical supplement to the reality of nature, placed alongside thereof for its conquest. It is Homer who has chiefly taught other poets the art of telling lies skillfully. For art to exist, for any sort of aesthetic activity to exist, a certain physiological precondition is indispensable: intoxication. I do not know what the spirit of a philosopher could more wish to be than a good dancer. For the dance is his ideal, also his fine art, finally also the only kind of piety he knows, his \\'divine service.\\' The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing. Were I called on to define, very briefly, the term Art, I should call it \\'the reproduction of what the Senses perceive in Nature through the veil of the soul.\\' The mere imitation, however accurate, of what is in Nature, entitles no man to the sacred name of \\'Artist.\\' When art dresses in worn-out material it is most easily recognized as art. Sleeping is no mean art: for its sake one must stay awake all day. Art raises its head where creeds relax. The bad gains respect through imitation, the good loses it especially in art. Envy is the art of counting the other fellow\\'s blessings instead of your own. Politics is the art of controlling your environment. Take care to sell your horse before he dies. The art of life is passing losses on. It is the function of art to renew our perception. What we are familiar with we cease to see. The writer shakes up the familiar scene, and, as if by magic, we see a new meaning in it. Next to the Word of God, the noble art of music is the greatest treasure in the world. She had lost the art of conversation but not, unfortunately, the power of speech. You use a glass mirror to see your face you use works of art to see your soul. Art is the beautiful way of doing things. Science is the effective way of doing things. Business is the economic way of doing things. \\x0cBeing good in business is the most fascinating kind of art. Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art. Sometimes being a friend means mastering the art of timing. There is a time for silence. A time to let go and allow people to hurl themselves into their own destiny. And a time to prepare to pick up the pieces when it\\'s all over. The art of government is the organisation of idolatry. Truly fertile Music, the only kind that will move us, that we shall truly appreciate, will be a Music conducive to Dream, which banishes all reason and analysis. One must not wish first to understand and then to feel. Art does not tolerate Reason. Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life. We\\'re going to shoot one Polaroid per show. I\\'m going to sign this before it even develops because I know that once it develops with my signature on it, it\\'s worth a fortune. I\\'ll make this a work of magic warlock art. Art is never finished, only abandoned. The art of government is to make two-thirds of a nation pay all it possibly can pay for the benefit of the other third. My goal is to be one with the music. I just dedicate my whole life to this art. Advertising is the art of convincing people to spend money they don\\'t have for something they don\\'t need. Love isn\\'t an emotion or an instinct - it\\'s an art. Motivation is the art of getting people to do what you want them to do because they want to do it. Democracy is the art and science of running the circus from the monkey cage. When you create art, the world has to wait. I started to make a study of the art of war and revolution and, whilst abroad, underwent a course in military training. If there was to be guerrilla warfare, I wanted to be able to stand and fight with my people and to share the hazards of war with them. The art of medicine consists in amusing the patient while nature cures the disease. Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter\\'s honor. \\x0cTo catch a husband is an art to hold him is a job. Rhetoric is the art of ruling the minds of men. In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy\\'s country whole and intact to shatter and destroy it is not so good. He who possesses art and science has religion he who does not possess them, needs religion. Originality is the fine art of remembering what you hear but forgetting where you heard it. Music is the art of the prophets and the gift of God. You must not fight too often with one enemy, or you will teach him all your art of war. The biggest problem with every art is by the use of appearance to create a loftier reality. Art is a lie that makes us realize truth. I think art is the only thing that\\'s spiritual in the world. And I refuse to forced to believe in other people\\'s interpretations of God. I don\\'t think anybody should be. No one person can own the copyright to what God means. I never called my work an \\'art\\'. It\\'s part of show business, the business of building entertainment. Religion is the masterpiece of the art of animal training, for it trains people as to how they shall think. Where the spirit does not work with the hand, there is no art. In a decaying society, art, if it is truthful, must also reflect decay. And unless it wants to break faith with its social function, art must show the world as changeable. And help to change it. The human foot is a masterpiece of engineering and a work of art. It is after all the greatest art to limit and isolate oneself. Good management is the art of making problems so interesting and their solutions so constructive that everyone wants to get to work and deal with them. Art is not a handicraft, it is the transmission of feeling the artist has experienced. Art is always and everywhere the secret confession, and at the same time the immortal movement of its time. \\x0cOne does not need buildings, money, power, or status to practice the Art of Peace. Heaven is right where you are standing, and that is the place to train. Art is not a treasure in the past or an importation from another land, but part of the present life of all living and creating peoples. Art is making something out of nothing and selling it. The art of being happy lies in the power of extracting happiness from common things. All married couples should learn the art of battle as they should learn the art of making love. Good battle is objective and honest - never vicious or cruel. Good battle is healthy and constructive, and brings to a marriage the principles of equal partnership. The web, then, or the pattern, a web at once sensuous and logical, an elegant and pregnant texture: that is style, that is the foundation of the art of literature. Dear God! how beauty varies in nature and art. In a woman the flesh must be like marble in a statue the marble must be like flesh. He who would do good to another must do it in Minute Particulars: general Good is the plea of the scoundrel, hypocrite, and flatterer, for Art and Science cannot exist but in minutely organized Particulars. When thou art above measure angry, bethink thee how momentary is man\\'s life. Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art. Europe is so well gardened that it resembles a work of art, a scientific theory, a neat metaphysical system. Man has re-created Europe in his own image. Surely all art is the result of one\\'s having been in danger, of having gone through an experience all the way to the end, where no one can go any further. I am a soul. I know well that what I shall render up to the grave is not myself. That which is myself will go elsewhere. Earth, thou art not my abyss! Photography is more than a medium for factual communication of ideas. It is a creative art. \\x0cPerhaps it\\'s good for one to suffer. Can an artist do anything if he\\'s happy? Would he ever want to do anything? What is art, after all, but a protest against the horrible inclemency of life? The art of war is simple enough. Find out where your enemy is. Get at him as soon as you can. Strike him as hard as you can, and keep moving on. The finest works of art are precious, among other reasons, because they make it possible for us to know, if only imperfectly and for a little while, what it actually feels like to think subtly and feel nobly. Art is the elimination of the unnecessary. I think most of the people involved in any art always secretly wonder whether they are really there because they\\'re good or there because they\\'re lucky. The art of life is to know how to enjoy a little and to endure very much. Tact is the art of making a point without making an enemy. To array a man\\'s will against his sickness is the supreme art of medicine. There are no contests in the Art of Peace. A true warrior is invincible because he or she contests with nothing. Defeat means to defeat the mind of contention that we harbor within. Logic: The art of thinking and reasoning in strict accordance with the limitations and incapacities of the human misunderstanding. Freedom in art, freedom in society, this is the double goal towards which all consistent and logical minds must strive. To my mind the old masters are not art their value is in their scarcity. Art is not the application of a canon of beauty but what the instinct and the brain can conceive beyond any canon. When we love a woman we don\\'t start measuring her limbs. Art is the lie that enables us to realize the truth. I went into the business for the money, and the art grew out of it. If people are disillusioned by that remark, I can\\'t help it. It\\'s the truth. The capacity to be puzzled is the premise of all creation, be it in art or in science. \\x0cWe want to answer this classical question, who am I? So I think that most of our works are for art, or whatever we do, including science or religion, tried to answer that question. Ethics is in origin the art of recommending to others the sacrifices required for cooperation with oneself. Dying is an art, like everything else. I do it exceptionally well. I do it so it feels like hell. I do it so it feels real. I guess you could say I\\'ve a call. Science fiction is any idea that occurs in the head and doesn\\'t exist yet, but soon will, and will change everything for everybody, and nothing will ever be the same again. As soon as you have an idea that changes some small part of the world you are writing science fiction. It is always the art of the possible, never the impossible. Life doesn\\'t imitate art, it imitates bad television. There is no abstract art. You must always start with something. Afterward you can remove all traces of reality. So many gods, so many creeds, so many paths that wind and wind while just the art of being kind is all the sad world needs. All in the Family was intellectual it was art. The person who knows one thing and does it better than anyone else, even if it only be the art of raising lentils, receives the crown he merits. If he raises all his energy to that end, he is a benefactor of mankind and its rewarded as such. We all know that Art is not truth. Art is a lie that makes us realize the truth, at least the truth that is given to us to understand. Religion is essentially the art and the theory of the remaking of man. Man is not a finished creation. What I dream of is an art of balance, of purity and serenity devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter - a soothing, calming influence on the mind, rather like a good armchair which provides relaxation from physical fatigue. All great art is the work of the whole living creature, body and soul, and chiefly of the soul. The people who make art their business are mostly imposters. Life is not an exact science, it is an art. \\x0cThe art of life is to live in the present moment, and to make that moment as perfect as we can by the realization that we are the instruments and expression of God Himself. To be able to endure odium is the first art to be learned by those who aspire to power. If thou art a man, admire those who attempt great things, even though they fail. Every bit of me is devoted to love and art. And I aspire to try to be a teacher to my young fans who feel just like I felt when I was younger. I just felt like a freak. I guess what I\\'m trying to say is I\\'m trying to liberate them, I want to free them of their fears and make them feel that they can make their own space in the world. No great art has ever been made without the artist having known danger. The enemy of art is the absence of limitations. Only through art can we emerge from ourselves and know what another person sees. Youth is the gift of nature, but age is a work of art. I think music is the greatest art form that exists, and I think people listen to music for different reasons, and it serves different purposes. Some of it is background music, and some of it is things that might affect a person\\'s day, if not their life, or change an attitude. The best songs are the ones that make you feel something. Art never improves, but... the material of art is never quite the same. Being an artist is dragging your innermost feelings out, giving a piece of yourself, no matter in which art form, in which medium. The challenge is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible, possible. Sculpture is the art of the intelligence. The art of living well and the art of dying well are one. What is Art? It is the response of man\\'s creative soul to the call of the Real. A great city, whose image dwells in the memory of man, is the type of some great idea. Rome represents conquest Faith hovers over the towers of Jerusalem and Athens embodies the pre-eminent quality of the antique world, Art. Art can never exist without naked beauty displayed. \\x0cI think having land and not ruining it is the most beautiful art that anybody could ever want to own.  In Art, man reveals himself and not his objects. Art is the tree of life. Science is the tree of death. And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart, till the Devil whispered behind the leaves \\'It\\'s pretty, but is it Art?\\' Eloquence, n. The art of orally persuading fools that white is the color that it appears to be. It includes the gift of making any color appear white. I am a poor man and of little worth, who is laboring in that art that God has given me in order to extend my life as long as possible. All architecture is great architecture after sunset perhaps architecture is really a nocturnal art, like the art of fireworks. Passion is universal humanity. Without it religion, history, romance and art would be useless. Progressive art can assist people to learn not only about the objective forces at work in the society in which they live, but also about the intensely social character of their interior lives. Ultimately, it can propel people toward social emancipation. Chance gives rise to thoughts, and chance removes them no art can keep or acquire them. Great art is as irrational as great music. It is mad with its own loveliness. A race is a work of art that people can look at and be affected in as many ways they\\'re capable of understanding. The art of leadership is saying no, not saying yes. It is very easy to say yes. Life is the art of drawing sufficient conclusions from insufficient premises. In seeking wisdom thou art wise in imagining that thou hast attained it - thou art a fool. Every happening, great and small, is a parable whereby God speaks to us, and the art of life is to get the message. Thou must be emptied of that wherewith thou art full, that thou mayest be filled with that whereof thou art empty. Great nations write their autobiographies in three manuscripts - the book of their deeds, the book of their words and the book of their art. \\x0cThe whole art of teaching is only the art of awakening the natural curiosity of young minds for the purpose of satisfying it afterwards.  Poetry is the art of substantiating shadows, and of lending existence to nothing. I say that democracy can never prove itself beyond cavil, until it founds and luxuriantly grows its own forms of art, poems, schools, theology, displacing all that exists, or that has been produced anywhere in the past, under opposite influences. Listen to your inner-voice: Surround yourself with loving, nurturing people. Fall in love with your art and find yourself. Music is the great communicator. Winners have the ability to step back from the canvas of their lives like an artist gaining perspective. They make their lives a work of art - an individual masterpiece. I am a walking piece of art every day, with my dreams and my ambitions forward at all times in an effort to inspire my fans to lead their life in that way. The art of motherhood involves much silent, unobtrusive self-denial, an hourly devotion which finds no detail too minute. The great art of life is sensation, to feel that we exist, even in pain. The foundation of empire is art and science. Remove them or degrade them, and the empire is no more. Empire follows art and not vice versa as Englishmen suppose. It is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art. It is no great art to say something briefly when, like Tacitus, one has something to say when one has nothing to say, however, and none the less writes a whole book and makes truth into a liar - that I call an achievement. If we know the divine art of concentration, if we know the divine art of meditation, if we know the divine art of contemplation, easily and consciously we can unite the inner world and the outer world. \\x0cWhen I am finishing a picture, I hold some God-made object up to it - a rock, a flower, the branch of a tree or my hand - as a final test. If the painting stands up beside a thing man cannot make, the painting is authentic. If there\\'s a clash between the two, it\\'s bad art. There is nothing new in art except talent. All that we call ideal in Greek or any other art, because to us it is false and visionary, was, to the makers of it, true and existent.  What is art? Nature concentrated. Creative without strategy is called \\'art.\\' Creative with strategy is called \\'advertising.\\' One of the interesting things here is that the people who should be shaping the future are politicians. But the political framework itself is so dead and closed that people look to other sources, like artists, because art and music allow people a certain freedom. All things are artificial, for nature is the art of God. History develops, art stands still. The momentous thing in human life is the art of winning the soul to good or evil. Life beats down and crushes the soul and art reminds you that you have one. True ease in writing comes from art, not chance, as those who move easiest have learned to dance. All humanity is passion without passion, religion, history, novels, art would be ineffectual. We are all hungry and thirsty for concrete images. Abstract art will have been good for one thing: to restore its exact virginity to figurative art. Those who gave thee a body, furnished it with weakness but He who gave thee Soul, armed thee with resolution. Employ it, and thou art wise be wise and thou art happy. Art has the power to transform, to illuminate, to educate, inspire and motivate. Art is only a means to life, to the life more abundant. It is not in itself the life more abundant. It merely points the way, something which is overlooked not only by the public, but very often by the artist himself. In becoming an end it defeats itself. The mother art is architecture. Without an architecture of our own we have no soul of our own civilization. \\x0cCriticism is the windows and chandeliers of art: it illuminates the enveloping darkness in which art might otherwise rest only vaguely discernible, and perhaps altogether unseen. What can be more foolish than to think that all this rare fabric of heaven and earth could come by chance, when all the skill of art is not able to make an oyster! The art of using deceit and cunning grow continually weaker and less effective to the user. Parents are usually more careful to bestow knowledge on their children rather than virtue, the art of speaking well rather than doing well but their manners should be of the greatest concern. Great artists are people who find the way to be themselves in their art. Any sort of pretension induces mediocrity in art and life alike. Really I don\\'t like human nature unless all candied over with art. O, thou art fairer than the evening air clad in the beauty of a thousand stars. What I\\'ve discovered is that in art, as in music, there\\'s a lot of truth-and then there\\'s a lie. The artist is essentially creating his work to make this lie a truth, but he slides it in amongst all the others. The tiny little lie is the moment I live for, my moment. It\\'s the moment that the audience falls in love. Where thou art, that is home. To speak of morals in art is to speak of legislature in sex. Art is the sex of the imagination. I don\\'t think about art when I\\'m working. I try to think about life. No art can be noble which is incapable of expressing thought, and no art is capable of expressing thought which does not change. Politics is the art of choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable. Poetry is the art of uniting pleasure with truth. Diplomacy: the art of restraining power. Land really is the best art. Criticism is the art of appraising others at one\\'s own value. To do a dull thing with style- now that\\'s what I call art. It is in this power of saying everything, and yet saying nothing too plainly, that the perfection of art consists. \\x0cThe art which we may call generally art of the wayside, as opposed to that which is the business of men\\'s lives, is, in the best sense of the word, Grotesque. Growing up going to Christian school and the concept that you\\'re born a sinner and you don\\'t really have a choice to change who you are has been hammered into my head and created the entire reason why I made art and made a band and made records called \\'Antichrist Superstar.\\' To me, photography is an art of observation. It\\'s about finding something interesting in an ordinary place... I\\'ve found it has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them. Cunning is the art of concealing our own defects, and discovering other people\\'s weaknesses. I realised the bohemian life was not for me. I would look around at my friends, living like starving artists, and wonder, \\'Where\\'s the art?\\' They weren\\'t doing anything. And there was so much interesting stuff to do, so much fun to be had... maybe I could even quit renting. Patience is the art of hoping. The man of genius is he and he alone who finds such joy in his art that he will work at it come hell or high water. Religion and art spring from the same root and are close kin. Economics and art are strangers. There is nothing in the world of art like the songs mother used to sing. Simplicity and repose are the qualities that measure the true value of any work of art. People who don\\'t like me talk about it as though I\\'m trash because I have tattoos. I find that insane because it\\'s 2008, not the 1950s. Tattoos aren\\'t limited to sailors. It\\'s a form of art I find beautiful. I love it. Music happens to be an art form that transcends language. Art is man\\'s constant effort to create for himself a different order of reality from that which is given to him. The true art of memory is the art of attention. It\\'s clever, but is it Art? The sinews of art and literature, like those of war, are money. \\x0cThe youth of an art is, like the youth of anything else, its most interesting period. When it has come to the knowledge of good and evil it is stronger, but we care less about it. What is comedy? Comedy is the art of making people laugh without making them puke. It is art that makes life, makes interest, makes importance... and I know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process. Diversity: the art of thinking independently together. The greatness of art is not to find what is common but what is unique. There is nothing, Sir, too little for so little a creature as man. It is by studying little things that we attain the great art of having as little misery and as much happiness as possible. Life is the art of being well deceived and in order that the deception may succeed it must be habitual and uninterrupted. All nature is but art unknown to thee. Men\\'s magazines often feature pictures of naked ladies. Women\\'s magazines also often feature pictures of naked ladies. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is hairy and lumpy and should not be seen by the light of day. What garlic is to salad, insanity is to art. My trade and art is to live. The only honest art form is laughter, comedy. You can\\'t fake it... try to fake three laughs in an hour - ha ha ha ha ha - they\\'ll take you away, man. You can\\'t. An artist cannot speak about his art any more than a plant can discuss horticulture. Art begins in imitation and ends in innovation. A work of art which did not begin in emotion is not art. Architecture is the art of how to waste space. Courtesy is a silver lining around the dark clouds of civilization it is the best part of refinement and in many ways, an art of heroic beauty in the vast gallery of man\\'s cruelty and baseness. Space is the breath of art. Art does not reproduce what we see rather, it makes us see. I think art education, especially in this country, which government pretty much ignores, is so important for young people. \\x0cFame is the echo of actions, resounding them to the world, save that the echo repeats only the last art, but fame relates all, and often more than all. If thou art a master, be sometimes blind if a servant, sometimes deaf. Art is an attempt to integrate evil. A work of art that contains theories is like an object on which the price tag has been left. To want friendship is a great fault. Friendship ought to be a gratuitous joy, like the joys afforded by art or life. Mild autism can give you a genius like Einstein. If you have severe autism, you could remain nonverbal. You don\\'t want people to be on the severe end of the spectrum. But if you got rid of all the autism genetics, you wouldn\\'t have science or art. All you would have is a bunch of social \\'yak yaks.\\'  The sadness of the incomplete, the sadness that is often Life, but should never be Art. Every work of art is an uncommitted crime. You have to master not only the art of listening to your head, you must also master listening to your heart and listening to your gut. One science only will one genius fit so vast is art, so narrow human wit. There is no prejudice that the work of art does not finally overcome. Memory is a great artist. For every man and for every woman it makes the recollection of his or her life a work of art and an unfaithful record. The wealthy are always surrounded by hangers-on science and art are as well. Like music and art, love of nature is a common language that can transcend political or social boundaries. The work of art assumes the existence of the perfect spectator, and is indifferent to the fact that no such person exists. Healing,\\' Papa would tell me, \\'is not a science, but the intuitive art of wooing nature. The first mistake of art is to assume that it\\'s serious. Good manners is the art of making those people easy with whom we converse. Whoever makes the fewest people uneasy is the best bred in the room. \\x0cLying just for the fun of it is either art or pathology. Death be not proud, though some have called thee Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so. For, those, whom thou think\\'st thou dost overthrow. Die not, poor death, nor yet canst thou kill me. Evil is committed without effort, naturally, fatally goodness is always the product of some art. The educator must believe in the potential power of his pupil, and he must employ all his art in seeking to bring his pupil to experience this power. The effort of art is to keep what is interesting in existence, to recreate it in the eternal. I consider skateboarding an art form, a lifestyle and a sport. \\'Action sport\\' would be the least offensive categorization.  In life, as in art, the beautiful moves in curves. Logic is neither an art nor a science but a dodge. The excellency of every art is its intensity, capable of making all disagreeable evaporate. Let each man exercise the art he knows. In science, as in art, and, as I believe, in every other sphere of human activity, there may be wisdom in a multitude of counsellors, but it is only in one or two of them. You may choose your words like a connoisseur, And polish it up with art, But the word that sways, and stirs, and stays, Is the word that comes from the heart. People are surprised at how down-to-earth I am. I like to stay home on Friday nights and listen to \\'The Art of Happiness\\' by the Dalai Lama. Emotion resulting from a work of art is only of value when it is not obtained by sentimental blackmail. All good art is an indiscretion. Great art is the contempt of a great man for small art. I believe entertainment can aspire to be art, and can become art, but if you set out to make art you\\'re an idiot. Art, as far as it is able, follows nature, as a pupil imitates his master thus your art must be, as it were, God\\'s grandchild. Gossip is the art of saying nothing in a way that leaves practically nothing unsaid. Errors are not in the art but in the artificers. \\x0cIt is veneer, rouge, aestheticism, art museums, new theaters, etc. that make America impotent. The good things are football, kindness, and jazz bands. Simplicity is the final achievement. After one has played a vast quantity of notes and more notes, it is simplicity that emerges as the crowning reward of art. Art is the objectification of feeling. There are worlds of experience beyond the world of the aggressive man, beyond history, and beyond science. The moods and qualities of nature and the revelations of great art are equally difficult to define we can grasp them only in the depths of our perceptive spirit. The beginning of a friendship, the fact that two people out of the thousands around them can meet and connect and become friends, seems like a kind of magic to me. But maintaining a friendship requires work. I don\\'t mean that as a bad thing. Good art requires work as well. The sole art that suits me is that which, rising from unrest, tends toward serenity. Art is the collaboration between God and the artist, and the less the artist does the better. Deliver me from writers who say the way they live doesn\\'t matter. I\\'m not sure a bad person can write a good book, If art doesn\\'t make us better, then what on earth is it for. Politics is not the art of the possible. It consists in choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable. Art has to move you and design does not, unless it\\'s a good design for a bus. The art of creation is older than the art of killing. The best part of the art of living is to know how to grow old gracefully. Every science begins as philosophy and ends as art. The love of all-inclusiveness is as dangerous in philosophy as in art. Great art is the outward expression of an inner life in the artist, and this inner life will result in his personal vision of the world. We work in the dark - we do what we can - we give what we have. Our doubt is our passion and our passion is our task. The rest is the madness of art. \\x0cBesides the noble art of getting things done, there is the noble art of leaving things undone. The wisdom of life consists in the elimination of non-essentials. Art is moral passion married to entertainment. Moral passion without entertainment is propaganda, and entertainment without moral passion is television. Telling lies is a fault in a boy, an art in a lover, an accomplishment in a bachelor, and second-nature in a married man. If you are going to break a Law of Art, make the crime interesting. The art of pleasing consists in being pleased. When science, art, literature, and philosophy are simply the manifestation of personality they are on a level where glorious and dazzling achievements are possible, which can make a man\\'s name live for thousands of years. Wherever the art of medicine is loved, there is also a love of humanity. Art is permitted to survive only if it renounces the right to be different, and integrates itself into the omnipotent realm of the profane. The counterfeit and counterpart of Nature is reproduced in art. The most seductive thing about art is the personality of the artist himself. The art of Peace I practice has room for each of the world\\'s eight million gods, and I cooperate with them all. The God of Peace is very great and enjoins all that is divine and enlightened in every land. I like it when somebody tells me a story, and I actually really feel that that\\'s becoming like a lost art in American cinema. There\\'s a lot of thought in art. People get to talk about important things. There\\'s a lot of sex, you know, in art. There\\'s a lot of naked women and men, and there\\'s intrigue, there\\'s fakery. It\\'s a real microcosm of the larger world. You want to be a bit compulsive in your art or craft or whatever you do. I\\'m enamored with the art world. Anytime you look at anything that\\'s considered artistic, there\\'s a commercial world around it: the ballet, opera, any kind of music. It can\\'t exist without it. \\x0cArt at its most significant is a Distant Early Warning System that can always be relied on to tell the old culture what is beginning to happen to it. Most works of art, like most wines, ought to be consumed in the district of their fabrication. Art is why I get up in the morning but my definition ends there. You know I don\\'t think its fair that I\\'m living for something I can\\'t even define. People believe that photographs are true and therefore cannot be art. Art seduces, but does not exploit. Art is the most beautiful deception of all. And although people try to incorporate the everyday events of life in it, we must hope that it will remain a deception lest it become a utilitarian thing, sad as a factory. To the man who loves art for its own sake, it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. Film will only became an art when its materials are as inexpensive as pencil and paper. In art and dream may you proceed with abandon. In life may you proceed with balance and stealth. Building art is a synthesis of life in materialised form. We should try to bring in under the same hat not a splintered way of thinking, but all in harmony together. Skill without imagination is craftsmanship and gives us many useful objects such as wickerwork picnic baskets. Imagination without skill gives us modern art. An art which isn\\'t based on feeling isn\\'t an art at all. The knowledge of God is the cause of things. For the knowledge of God is to all creatures what the knowledge of the artificer is to things made by his art. I can\\'t satisfy myself with just trying to tie all of my imagination into music, especially when music is not appreciated as an art form as much as it used to be. Art gives me the freedom I don\\'t have when I make music. The idea is, if I can\\'t heal from my art, then how can you heal? Riding a race bike is an art - a thing that you do because you feel something inside. \\x0cI try to keep a low profile in general. Not with my art, but just as a person. In general it can be said that a nation\\'s art is greatest when it most reflects the character of its people. At the University of Maryland, my first year I started off planning to major in art because I was interested in theatre design, stage design or television design. What an artist is trying to do for people is bring them closer to something, because of course art is about sharing. You wouldn\\'t be an artist unless you wanted to share an experience, a thought. What is art? Prostitution. Art is not what you see, but what you make others see. Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions there is no single definition. Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that\\'s why it is so complicated. I don\\'t have anything to say about other people\\'s art and their work. Patience is the art of concealing your impatience. The screen is a magic medium. It has such power that it can retain interest as it conveys emotions and moods that no other art form can hope to tackle. For his heart was in his work, and the heart giveth grace unto every art. Resolve and thou art free. Art is a harmony parallel with nature. Film as dream, film as music. No art passes our conscience in the way film does, and goes directly to our feelings, deep down into the dark rooms of our souls. I do not want art for a few any more than education for a few, or freedom for a few. The style of ancient Egyptian art is transcendently clear, something 8-year-olds can recognize in an instant. Its consistency and codification is one of the most epic visual journeys in all art, one that lasts 30 dynasties spread over 3,000 years. Egotism: The art of seeing in yourself what others cannot see. A work of art has no importance whatever to society. It is only important to the individual. \\x0cI don\\'t think any movie or any book or any work of art can solve the stalemate in the Middle East today. But it\\'s certainly worth a try. I think that one\\'s art is a growth inside one. I do not think one can explain growth. It is silent and subtle. One does not keep digging up a plant to see how it grows. It is a sad fact about our culture that a poet can earn much more money writing or talking about his art than he can by practicing it. After a few months in my parents\\' basement, I took an apartment near the state university, where I discovered both crystal methamphetamine and conceptual art. Either one of these things are dangerous, but in combination they have the potential to destroy entire civilizations. To know how to grow old is the master work of wisdom, and one of the most difficult chapters in the great art of living. I had wanted a tape recorder since I was tiny. I thought it was a magic thing. I never got one until just before I went to art school. It is not hard to understand modern art. If it hangs on a wall it\\'s a painting, and if you can walk around it it\\'s a sculpture. Art is anything you can get away with. Everything a writer learns about the art or craft of fiction takes just a little away from his need or desire to write at all. In the end he knows all the tricks and has nothing to say. Nature scarcely ever gives us the very best for that we must have recourse to art. To say nothing, especially when speaking, is half the art of diplomacy. Design in art, is a recognition of the relation between various things, various elements in the creative flux. You can\\'t invent a design. You recognize it, in the fourth dimension. That is, with your blood and your bones, as well as with your eyes. Oh literature, oh the glorious Art, how it preys upon the marrow in our bones. It scoops the stuffing out of us, and chucks us aside. Alas! Everyone discusses my art and pretends to understand, as if it were necessary to understand, when it is simply necessary to love. \\x0cIn its most limited sense, modern, art would seem to concern itself only with the technical innovations of the period. The question of the value of nationality in art is perhaps unsolvable. The trend in some of the contemporary movements in art, but by no means all, seems to deny this ideal and to me appears to lead to a purely decorative conception of painting. Life is short, the art long. Everything that has ever been called folk art has always reflected domination. Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don\\'t live it, it won\\'t come out of your horn. They teach you there\\'s a boundary line to music. But, man, there\\'s no boundary line to art. My age and health will never allow me to realize the dream of art I\\'ve been pursuing all my life. Don\\'t be an art critic. Paint. There lies salvation. Film editing is now something almost everyone can do at a simple level and enjoy it, but to take it to a higher level requires the same dedication and persistence that any art form does. Love and business and family and religion and art and patriotism are nothing but shadows of words when a man\\'s starving! It ought to be illegal for an artist to marry. If the artist must marry let him find someone more interested in art, or his art, or the artist part of him, than in him. After which let them take tea together three times a week. It is not in life, but in art that self-fulfillment is to be found. Art lies by its own artifice. Art has a double face, of expression and illusion, just like science has a double face: the reality of error and the phantom of truth. Art and works of art do not make an artist sense and enthusiasm and instinct do. You can\\'t but know that if you can capture the emotions of the audience as well as their minds, the play will work better, because it\\'s a narrative art form. Teachers believe they have a gift for giving it drives them with the same irrepressible drive that drives others to create a work of art or a market or a building. \\x0cThe art challenges the technology, and the technology inspires the art. To say the word Romanticism is to say modern art - that is, intimacy, spirituality, color, aspiration towards the infinite, expressed by every means available to the arts. What strikes me is the fact that in our society, art has become something which is only related to objects, and not to individuals, or to life. Art is so subjective, and people can react however they want. I\\'m free. I just do what I want, say what I want, say how I feel, and I don\\'t try to hurt nobody. I just try to make sure that I don\\'t compromise my art in any kind of way, and I think people respect that. Rumors sound of galleries asking artists for upsized art and more of it. I\\'ve heard of photographers asked to print larger to increase the wall power and salability of their work. Everything winds up set to maximum in order to feed the beast. To engage with art, we have to be willing to be wrong, venture outside our psychic comfort zones, suspend disbelief, and remember that art explores and alters consciousness simultaneously. Summer is a great time to visit art museums, which offer the refreshing rinse of swimming pools - only instead of cool water, you immerse yourself in art.  I can\\'t bear art that you can walk round and admire. A book should be either a bandit or a rebel or a man in the crowd. Since obscenity is the truth of our passion today, it is the only stuff of art - or almost the only stuff. The essential function of art is moral. But a passionate, implicit morality, not didactic. A morality which changes the blood, rather than the mind. I am more a friend of art than a producer of painting. You say a new era in art is preparing you sensed it coming continue your studies without weakening. God will do the rest. I have nothing to hide in art. The initial force alone can bring anyone to the end he must attain. Is art really the priesthood that demands the pure in heart who belong to it wholly? \\x0cA frenzied passion for art is a canker that devours everything else. Evil is done without effort, naturally, it is the working of fate good is always the product of an art. I didn\\'t grow up thinking of movies as film, or art, but as movies, something to do on a Saturday afternoon. The art of living is the art of knowing how to believe lies. Let\\'s talk of a system that transforms all the social organisms into a work of art, in which the entire process of work is included... something in which the principle of production and consumption takes on a form of quality. It\\'s a Gigantic project. Any authentic work of art must start an argument between the artist and his audience. History repeats itself, but the special call of an art which has passed away is never reproduced. It is as utterly gone out of the world as the song of a destroyed wild bird. One of the most amazing things about mathematics is the people who do math aren\\'t usually interested in application, because mathematics itself is truly a beautiful art form. It\\'s structures and patterns, and that\\'s what we love, and that\\'s what we get off on. A rose is the visible result of an infinitude of complicated goings on in the bosom of the earth and in the air above, and similarly a work of art is the product of strange activities in the human mind.  It was Public Art, defined as art that is purchased by experts who are not spending their own personal money. Art is not necessary at all. All that is necessary to make this world a better place to live in is to love - to love as Christ loved, as Buddha loved. Advertising is fundamentally persuasion and persuasion happens to be not a science, but an art. I was doing these performance art pop music pieces in the city. And they were a bit on the eccentric side I suppose. So people started to call me Gaga after the Queen song \\'Radio Gaga.\\' Medicine is not only a science it is also an art. It does not consist of compounding pills and plasters it deals with the very processes of life, which must be understood before they may be guided. \\x0cI would no more quarrel with a man because of his religion than I would because of his art. So long as the system of competition in the production and exchange of the means of life goes on, the degradation of the arts will go on and if that system is to last for ever, then art is doomed, and will surely die that is to say, civilization will die. Poor Georgia O\\'Keeffe. Death didn\\'t soften the opinions of the art world toward her paintings. I\\'ve always said that an art critic can put aside politics around art. Megacollectors suppose they can enter art history by spending astronomical amounts. The art gods cooked up something special for James Ensor. All art comes from other art, and all immigrants come from other places. When art wins, everyone wins. I have a soft spot for art that, in terms of subject matter and material, is in bad taste. Art is changing. Again. Here. Now. Opportunities to witness this are rare, so attend and observe. Art is good, bad, boring, ugly, useful to us or not. Recessions are hard on people, but they are not hard on art. I like that the art world isn\\'t regulated. The art world is molting - some would say melting. Galleries are closing museums are scaling back.  Almost all institutions own a lot more art than they can ever show, much of it revealing for its timeliness, genius, or sheer weirdness. The forties, seventies, and the nineties, when money was scarce, were great periods, when the art world retracted but it was also reborn. Robert Rauschenberg was not a giant of American art he was the giant. No American created so many aesthetic openings for so many artists. The Met is not only the finest encyclopedic museum of art in the United States it is arguably the finest anywhere. Money is something that can be measured art is not. It\\'s all subjective. Contrary to popular opinion, things don\\'t go stale particularly fast in the art world. \\x0cArt usually only makes the news in America when the subject is money. I hate art auctions. The price of a work of art has nothing to do with what the work of art is, can do, or is worth on an existential, alchemical level. To me, nothing in the art world is neutral. The idea of \\'disinterest\\' strikes me as boring, dishonest, dubious, and uninteresting. The art world is an all- volunteer force. No one has to be here if he or she doesn\\'t want to be, and we should be associating with anyone we want to. Wolfgang Tillman\\'s stunning large-scale pictures, being shown for the first time, were so offhand I failed to see them as art. Galleries began growing in both number and size in the late seventies, when artists who worked in lofts wanted to exhibit their work in spaces similar to the ones the art was made in. There\\'s something pleasing about large, well-lit spaces. I love that dealers are willing to take massive chances in order to give this much room to their artists. Most of all, I love that more galleries showing more art gives more artists a shot. First let me report that the art in the Barnes Collection has never looked better. My trips to the old Barnes were always amazing, but except on the sunniest days, you could barely see the art. The building always felt pushed beyond its capacity. Not to say people shouldn\\'t get rich from art. I adore the alchemy wherein artists who cast a complex spell make rich people give them their money. (Just writing it makes me cackle.) But too many artists have been making money without magic. These days, newish art can be priced between $10,000 and $25,000. When I tell artists that a new painting by a newish artist should go for around $1,200, they look at me like I\\'m a flesh-eating virus. In art, scandal is a false narrative, a smoke screen that camouflages rather than reveals. When we don\\'t know what we\\'re seeing, we overreact. \\x0cDamien Hirst is the Elvis of the English art world, its ayatollah, deliverer, and big- thinking entrepreneurial potty- mouthed prophet and front man. Hirst synthesizes punk, Pop Art, Jeff Koons, Marcel Duchamp, Francis Bacon, and Catholicism. Anyone who relishes art should love the extraordinary diversity and psychic magic of our art galleries. There\\'s likely more combined square footage for the showing of art on one New York block - West 24th Street between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues - than in all of Amsterdam\\'s or Hamburg\\'s galleries. Yes, 85 percent of the art you see isn\\'t any good. But everyone has a different opinion about which 85 percent is bad. That in turn creates fantastically unstable interplay and argument. Many museums are drawing audiences with art that is ostensibly more entertaining than stuff that just sits and invites contemplation. Interactivity, gizmos, eating, hanging out, things that make noise - all are now the norm, often edging out much else. Imagine it\\'s 1981. You\\'re an artist, in love with art, smitten with art history. You\\'re also a woman, with almost no mentors to look to art history just isn\\'t that into you. Any woman approaching art history in the early eighties was attempting to enter an almost foreign country, a restricted and exclusionary domain that spoke a private language. Willem de Kooning is generally credited for coming out of the painterly gates strong in the forties, revolutionizing art and abstraction and reaching incredible heights by the early fifties, and then tailing off. I also take pleasure in the so- called negative power in Grotjahn\\'s work. That is, I love his paintings for what they are not. Unlike much art of the past decade, Grotjahn isn\\'t simply working from a prescribed checklist of academically acceptable, curator-approved \\'isms\\' and twists. It is not possible to overstate the influence of Paul Cezanne on twentieth-century art. He\\'s the modern Giotto, someone who shattered one kind of picture-making and invented a new one that the world followed. \\x0cThe greatest work of art about New York? The question seems nebulous. The city\\'s magic and majesty are distilled in the photographs of Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand. Abstract Expressionism - the first American movement to have a worldwide influence - was remarkably short-lived: It heated up after World War II and was all but done for by 1960 (although visit any art school today and you\\'ll find a would-be Willem de Kooning). My culture-deprived, aspirational mother dragged me once a month from our northern suburb - where the word art never came up - to the Art Institute of Chicago. I hated it. I\\'m noticing a new approach to art making in recent museum and gallery shows. It flickered into focus at the New Museum\\'s \\'Younger Than Jesus\\' last year and ran through the Whitney Biennial, and I\\'m seeing it blossom and bear fruit at \\'Greater New York,\\' MoMA P.S. 1\\'s twice-a- decade extravaganza of emerging local talent. Outside museums, in noisy public squares, people look at people. Inside museums, we leave that realm and enter what might be called the group-mind, getting quiet to look at art. It took the Metropolitan Museum of Art nearly 50 years to wake up to Pablo Picasso. It didn\\'t own one of his paintings until 1946, when Gertrude Stein bequeathed that indomitable quasi- Cubistic picture of herself - a portrait of the writer as a sumo Buddha - to the Met, principally because she disliked the Museum of Modern Art. All of Koons\\'s best art - the encased vacuum cleaners, the stainless-steel Rabbit (the late-twentieth century\\'s signature work of Simulationist sculpture), the amazing gleaming Balloon Dog, and the cast-iron re- creation of a Civil War mortar exhibited last month at the Armory - has simultaneously flaunted extreme realism, idealism, and fantasy. Venice is the perfect place for a phase of art to die. No other city on earth embraces entropy quite like this magical floating mall. \\x0cAppropriation is the idea that ate the art world. Go to any Chelsea gallery or international biennial and you\\'ll find it. It\\'s there in paintings of photographs, photographs of advertising, sculpture with ready-made objects, videos using already- existing film. After its hothouse incubation in the seventies, appropriation breathed important new life into art. This life flowered spectacularly over the decades - even if it\\'s now close to aesthetic kudzu. The New York art world readily proves people wrong. Just when folks say that things stink and flibbertigibbet critics wish the worst on us all because we\\'re not pure enough, good omens appear. Artistic qualities that once seemed undeniable don\\'t seem so now. Sometimes these fluctuations are only fickleness of taste, momentary glitches in an artist\\'s work, or an artist getting ahead of his audience (it took me ten years to catch up to Albert Oehlen). Other times, however, these problems mean there\\'s something wrong with the art. Can space break? I mean the space of art galleries. Over the past 100 years, art galleries have gone from looking like Beaux Arts salons to simple storefronts to industrial lofts to the gleaming giant white cubes of Chelsea with their shiny concrete floors. It\\'s great that New York has large spaces for art. But the enormous immaculate box has become a dated, even oppressive place. Many of these spaces were designed for sprawling installations, large paintings, and the Relational Aesthetics work of the past fifteen years. The giant white cube is now impeding rather than enhancing the rhythms of art. It preprograms a viewer\\'s journey, shifts the emphasis from process to product, and lacks individuality and openness. It\\'s not that art should be seen only in rutty bombed-out environments, but it should seem alive. It\\'s art that pushes against psychological and social expectations, that tries to transform decay into something generative, that is replicative in a baroque way, that isn\\'t about progress, and wants to - as Walt Whitman put it - \\'contain multitudes.\\' \\x0cThe last time money left the art world, intrepid types maxed out their credit cards and opened galleries, and a few of them have become the best in the world. Much good art got made while money ruled I like a lot of it, and hardship and poverty aren\\'t virtues. The good news is that, since almost no one will be selling art, artists - especially emerging ones - won\\'t have to think about turning out a consistent style or creating a brand. They\\'ll be able to experiment as much as they want. While a large segment of the art world has obsessed over a tiny number of stars and their prices, an aesthetic shift has been occurring. It\\'s not a movement - movements are more sure of themselves. It\\'s a change of mood or expectation, a desire for art to be more than showy effects, big numbers, and gamesmanship. When money and hype recede from the art world, one thing I won\\'t miss will be what curator Francesco Bonami calls the \\'Eventocracy.\\' All this flashy \\'art-fair art\\' and those highly produced space-eating spectacles and installations wow you for a minute until you move on to the next adrenaline event. A saboteur in the house of art and a comedienne in the house of art theory, Lawler has spent three decades documenting the secret life of art. Functioning as a kind of one-woman CSI unit, she has photographed pictures and objects in collectors\\' homes, in galleries, on the walls of auction houses, and off the walls, in museum storage. Works of art often last forever, or nearly so. But exhibitions themselves, especially gallery exhibitions, are like flowers they bloom and then they die, then exist only as memories, or pressed in magazines and books. If only we could persuade galleries to observe a fallow period in which, for two months every other year, new and old works of art could be sold in back rooms and all main galleries would be devoted to revisiting shows gone by. A canon is antithetical to everything the New York art world has been about for the past 40 years, during which we went from being the center of the art world to being one of many centers. \\x0cIt took me twenty years to get Steven Parrino\\'s work. From the time I first saw his art, in the mid-eighties, I almost always dismissed it as mannered, Romantic, formulaic, conceptualist- formalist heavy-metal boy-art abstraction. Untitled\\' is a time machine that can transport you to 1992, an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling, money was scarce, and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings, performance art, John Cage, Joseph Beuys, and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;art 4334;Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it\\'s never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.;Jerry Saltz;art 4335;A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.;Jerry Saltz;art 4336;The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.;Jerry Saltz;art 4337;Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.;Jerry Saltz;art 4338;Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art\\'s wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.;Jerry Saltz;art 4339;\\'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,\\' the Whitney Museum\\'s 40th- anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, \\x0cprovides moments of buzzy fun, but it\\'ll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.;Jerry Saltz;art 4340;Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art 4341;Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don\\'t only rely on this supply-and- demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art 4342;The reason the art world doesn\\'t respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject- matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They\\'re all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art 4343;Kinkade\\'s paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I\\'d love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade\\'s work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art 4344;Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art 4345;Artschwager\\'s art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you\\'re looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art 4346;Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art\\'s version of Einstein\\'s Theory of Relativity. It\\'s the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4347;The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I\\'ve ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art 4348;If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least \\x0ctwo great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn\\'t too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art 4349;Art is for anyone. It just isn\\'t for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that\\'s irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art 4350;I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art 4351;A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, \\'The Clock\\' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of- consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art 4352;I don\\'t know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I\\'ve gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art 4353;I love art dealers. In some ways, they\\'re my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art 4354;When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art 4355;I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I\\'m in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from \\x0cgood.;Jerry Saltz;art 4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he\\'s the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he\\'s the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you\\'re talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art 4357;Many say an art dealer running a museum is a \\'conflict of interest.\\' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art 4358;Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren\\'t necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art 4359;We\\'re all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We\\'re also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art 4360;Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art 4361;I don\\'t listen to what art critics say.

Another unsettling element in modern art is that common symptom of immaturity, the dread of doing what has been done before. Art is the signature of civilizations. Although all the good arts serve to draw man\\'s mind away from vices and lead it toward better things, this function can be more fully performed by this art, which also provides extraordinary intellectual pleasure. The details are the very source of expression in architecture. But we are caught in a vice between art and the bottom line. Surrealism: An archaic term. Formerly an art movement. No longer distinguishable from everyday life. I try to give people a different way of looking at their surroundings. That\\'s art to me. Translation is the art of failure. Life is very nice, but it lacks form. It\\'s the aim of art to give it some. I\\'m very happy to hear that my work inspires writers and painters. It\\'s the most beautiful compliment, the greatest reward. Art should always be an exchange. Literature is the art of discovering something extraordinary about ordinary people, and saying with ordinary words something extraordinary. Raising children is a creative endeavor, an art rather than a science. The whole aspect of cinema and film festivals should be a moment to come together and celebrate art and humanity. It would be a shame if there was such a divide. \\x0cThe art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups. All art is exorcism. I paint dreams and visions too the dreams and visions of my time. Painting is the effort to produce order order in yourself. There is much chaos in me, much chaos in our time. Shadows sometimes people don\\'t see shadows. The Chinese of course never paint them in pictures, oriental art never deals with shadow. But I noticed these shadows and I knew it meant it was sunny. Success and the art of making music are two different things for me. People criticized me for my photography. They said it\\'s not art. I always feel like the art\\'s there and I just see it, so it\\'s not really a lot of work. I went to art school actually when I was sixteen years old. How can anybody learn anything from an artwork when the piece of art only reflects the vanity of the artist and not reality? Anyway I feel myself a bit on the edge on the art world, but I don\\'t mind, I\\'m just pursuing my work in a very excited way. And there isn\\'t really a mainstream anymore, is there? If you don\\'t get noticed, you don\\'t have anything. You just have to be noticed, but the art is in getting noticed naturally, without screaming or without tricks. It seems almost backwards to me that my music seems the more emotional outlet, and the art stuff seems more about ideas. Real popular culture is folk art - coalminers\\' songs and so forth. I want to serve chess through games, books that are works of art. I would like to bring the game closer to many people all over the world. It\\'s important to debunk the myths of Africa being this benighted continent civilized only when white people arrived. In fact, Africans had been creators of culture for thousands of years before. These were very intelligent, subtle and sophisticated people, with organized societies and great art. \\x0cIn our life there is a single color, as on an artist\\'s palette, which provides the meaning of life and art. It is the color of love. I want art to make me think. In order to do that, it may piss me off, or make me uncomfortable. That promotes awareness and change, or at least some discussion. Art is vice. You don\\'t marry it legitimately, you rape it. Controversy is part of the nature of art and creativity. Oh yeah, I mean every fighter has got be dedicated, learn how to sacrifice, know what the devotion is all about, make sure you\\'re paying attention and studying your art. I am an anarchist in politics and an impressionist in art as well as a symbolist in literature. Not that I understand what these terms mean, but I take them to be all merely synonyms of pessimist. The Dancer believes that his art has something to say which cannot be expressed in words or in any other way than by dancing. Life is like art. You have to work hard to keep it simple and still have meaning. Ability is the art of getting credit for all the home runs somebody else hits. Interpretation is the revenge of the intellectual upon art. The 1990s, after the reign of terror of academic vandalism, will be a decade of restoration: restoration of meaning, value, beauty, pleasure, and emotion to art and restoration of art to its audience. In an era ruled by materialism and unstable geopolitics, art must be restored to the center of public education. Because most of my career in the classroom has been at art schools (beginning at Bennington in the 1970s), I am hyper-aware of the often grotesque disconnect between commentary on the arts and the actual practice or production of the arts. One of the main reasons I am so drawn to Hitchcock is that he planned his shots way in advance on story-boards, which he designed like classic paintings (he was an art connoisseur). It\\'s why he found shooting on set boring - because he had already composed the film in his head. \\x0cMadonna remains the most visible performer on the planet, as well as one of the wealthiest, but would anyone seriously say that artistic self- development is her primary motivating principle? She is too busy with Kabbalah, fashion merchandising, adoption melodramas, the gym, and ill-starred horseback riding to study art. It\\'s high time for the art world to admit that the avant-garde is dead. It was killed by my hero, Andy Warhol, who incorporated into his art all the gaudy commercial imagery of capitalism (like Campbell\\'s soup cans) that most artists had stubbornly scorned. To me, art supplies are always okay to buy. Art is something to be proud of. Art is no compromise. But theater, because of its nature, both text, images, multimedia effects, has a wider base of communication with an audience. That\\'s why I call it the most social of the various art forms. The problem is that once the rules of art are debunked, and once the unpleasant realities the irony diagnoses are revealed and diagnosed, \\'then\\' what do we do? Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That\\'s how I get my kicks. Courage is the art of being the only one who knows you\\'re scared to death. The downfall of the industry seems to actually be good for art. I think the industry will find their way once the focus shifts from its greed-based origins, downsizes, and begins to support creative visions that speak to our times and shifting ideals. The art of healing comes from nature, not from the physician. Therefore the physician must start from nature, with an open mind. The new job of art is to sit on the wall and get more expensive. I am not a great cook, I am not a great artist, but I love art, and I love food, so I am the perfect traveller. Art must take reality by surprise. \\x0cWhat you have now is a Hollywood that is pure poison. Hollywood was a central place in the history of art in the 20th century: it was human idealism preserved. And then, like any great place, it collapsed, and it collapsed into the most awful machinery in the world. I have a small house so I borrow everything except art, that\\'s what I love. I think people should be given a test much like driver\\'s tests as to whether they\\'re capable of being parents! It\\'s an art form. I talk a lot. And I think a lot. And I draw a lot. But never in a million years would I have been a parent. That\\'s just work that\\'s too hard. I owe much to mother. She had an expert\\'s understanding, but also approached art emotionally. For me, pointing and clicking my phone is absolutely fine. People say that isn\\'t the art of photography but I don\\'t agree. Art is the concrete representation of our most subtle feelings. Wisdom is nothing but a preparation of the soul, a capacity, a secret art of thinking, feeling and breathing thoughts of unity at every moment of life. For as long as I can remember I have suffered from a deep feeling of anxiety which I have tried to express in my art. If you cannot learn to love real art at least learn to hate sham art. The greater the decrease in the social significance of an art form, the sharper the distinction between criticism and enjoyment by the public. The conventional is uncritically enjoyed, and the truly new is criticized with aversion. Literature flourishes best when it is half a trade and half an art. Fashion often starts off beautiful and becomes ugly, whereas art starts off ugly sometimes and becomes beautiful. The art of storytelling is reaching its end because the epic side of truth, wisdom, is dying out. Art evokes the mystery without which the world would not exist. What matters poverty? What matters anything to him who is enamoured of our art? Does he not carry in himself every joy and every beauty? \\x0cFilm is a very young art that is still evolving. Soon, we shall reach a balance between content and technology. All I owe the world is my art. Art is dangerous. It is one of the attractions: when it ceases to be dangerous you don\\'t want it. Aesthetic emotion puts man in a state favorable to the reception of erotic emotion. Art is the accomplice of love. Take love away and there is no longer art. When the bright angel dominates, out comes a great work of art, a Michelangelo David or a Beethoven symphony. I like the fact that in ancient Chinese art the great painters always included a deliberate flaw in their work: human creation is never perfect. I\\'m not dead and I don\\'t have blue hair but some people say there are similarities. It is usually intolerable to watch myself onscreen but this time it\\'s fine. I think it\\'s beautiful and a real work of art. More than art, more than literature, music is universally accessible. I think no artist can claim to have any access to the truth, or an authentic version of an event. But obviously they have slightly better means at their disposal because they have their art to energize whatever it is they\\'re trying to write about. They have music. Every man should follow the bent of his nature in art and letters, always provided that he does not offend against the rules of morality and good taste. He has only half learned the art of reading who has not added to it the more refined art of skipping and skimming. If only life could be a little more tender and art a little more robust. Seek art from every time and place, in any form, to connect with those who really move you. Back then, I didn\\'t have a big organization around me. I was just a kid with a guitar, traveling around. My responsibility basically was to the art, and I had extra time on my hands. There is no extra time now. There isn\\'t enough time. There\\'s no being wrong in seeing something in art, only being disagreed with. \\x0cThe art of living does not consist in preserving and clinging to a particular mode of happiness, but in allowing happiness to change its form without being disappointed by the change happiness, like a child, must be allowed to grow up. I think good art does come from a dark place. I think of art as the highest level of creativity. To me, it is one of the greatest sources of enjoyment. Literature has drawn a funny perimeter that other art forms haven\\'t. Reading is an art form, and every man can be an artist. It is a myth that art has to be sold. It is not like stocking a grocery store where people fill a pushcart. Art is a product that has no apparent need. The salesperson builds the need in the mind of the buyer. What I\\'m doing is art - it\\'s low- brow art but there\\'s a magic in that. Art allows people a way to dream their way out of their struggle. I just like art. I get pure pleasure from it. I have a lot of wonderful paintings, and every time I look at them I see something different. I realize that every picture isn\\'t a work of art. To be honest, I sort of feel like \\'movie actor\\' isn\\'t of this time. I love it. But it\\'s a 20th-century art form. I view art as an inspirational tool. What is art but a way of seeing? Any fool can have bad luck the art consists in knowing how to exploit it. Good art provides people with a vocabulary about things they can\\'t articulate. It has taken me years of struggle, hard work and research to learn to make one simple gesture, and I know enough about the art of writing to realize that it would take as many years of concentrated effort to write one simple, beautiful sentence. Art may imitate life, but life imitates TV. Celebrity doesn\\'t have anything to do with art or craft. It\\'s about being rich and thinking that you\\'re better than everybody else. It is commonly supposed that the art of pleasing is a wonderful aid in the pursuit of fortune but the art of being bored is infinitely more successful. \\x0cI\\'ve sort of escaped my background, as people often do, through art and culture. It is the glory and good of Art, That Art remains the one way possible Of speaking truth, to mouths like mine at least. The art of the parenthesis is one of the greatest secrets of eloquence in Society. The worst state of affairs is when science begins to concern itself with art. I was the hero of the young insurgent working class art movement. Thou art my single day, God lends to leaven What were all earth else, with a feel of heaven. The art of being sick is not the same as the art of getting well. Poetry is emotion put into measure. The emotion must come by nature, but the measure can be acquired by art. I\\'d like to introduce someone who has just come into my life. I\\'ve admired him for 35 years. He\\'s someone who represents integrity, honesty, art, and on top of that stuff I\\'m actually sleeping with him. An art whose medium is language will always show a high degree of critical creativeness, for speech is itself a critique of life: it names, it characterizes, it passes judgment, in that it creates. Art is nothing but the expression of our dream the more we surrender to it the closer we get to the inner truth of things, our dream-life, the true life that scorns questions and does not see them. The art of communication is the language of leadership. I love to collect modern art. For nine years I worked to change what was hairdressing then into a geometric art form with color, perm without setting which had never been done before. I choose films for their artistic value. I don\\'t need a mansion or a Jaguar. When I leave this Earth, I won\\'t take any money with me. All I will leave behind will be my art. Alchemy is the art of far and near, and I think poetry is alchemy in that way. It\\'s delightful to distort size, to see something that\\'s tiny as though it were vast. Only in men\\'s imagination does every truth find an effective and undeniable existence. Imagination, not invention, is the supreme master of art as of life. \\x0cThe idea of avant-garde art is a very suspicious thing to me, the idea that poetry is new and it keeps being new the way Chevrolets every year are new. Any work that aspires, however humbly, to the condition of art should carry its justification in every line. When thou art at Rome, do as they do at Rome. Rock isn\\'t art, it\\'s the way ordinary people talk. Tell me thy company, and I\\'ll tell thee what thou art. Book-jacket design may become a lost art, like album- cover design, without which late-20th-century iconography would have been pauperized.  Art is nature speeded up and God slowed down. There was a big drive when I was at art school to make you aware of the economy of meaning - after all, this was still during the tail end of minimalism. Being responsible for everything you put in your picture, and being able to defend it. Keeping everything clear around you so you know what is operating. To open the wound and keep it clean. I was very much into buying contemporary art, but I\\'ve just decided I want to get rid of it all. Not that it\\'s not great art, but all of a sudden my mood has changed, and I want to go back to seventeenth- and eighteenth-century masters. I did this Super-8 film at art school called \\'Tissues,\\' this black comedy about a family whose father has been arrested for child molestation. I was absolutely thrilled by every inch of it, and would throw my projector in the back of my car and show it to anybody who would watch it. The great art of films does not consist of descriptive movement of face and body but in the movements of thought and soul transmitted in a kind of intense isolation. Magic becomes art when it has nothing to hide. Science is spectral analysis. Art is light synthesis. My first love is art, and I see a lot of things in an artistic way. In my world, history comes down to language and art. No one cares much about what battles were fought, who won them and who lost them - unless there is a painting, a play, a song or a poem that speaks of the event. A compromise is the art of dividing a cake in such a way that everyone believes he has the biggest piece. \\x0cWushu is a move in Chinese, a physical move. An attack. Wushu is like an art. Choosing to be positive and having a grateful attitude is going to determine how you\\'re going to live your life. My attitude is that if you push me towards something that you think is a weakness, then I will turn that perceived weakness into a strength. Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character. Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude.  Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference. Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude. There is little difference in people, but that little difference makes a big difference. The little difference is attitude. The big difference is whether it is positive or negative. Develop an attitude of gratitude, and give thanks for everything that happens to you, knowing that every step forward is a step toward achieving something bigger and better than your current situation. Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms - to choose one\\'s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\\'s own way. A positive attitude causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts, events and outcomes. It is a catalyst and it sparks extraordinary results. Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people whom we personally dislike. It is not the body\\'s posture, but the heart\\'s attitude that counts when we pray. People may hear your words, but they feel your attitude. But the attitude of faith is to let go, and become open to truth, whatever it might turn out to be. Character is the result of two things: mental attitude and the way we spend our time. Our attitude towards others determines their attitude towards us. Adopting the right attitude can convert a negative stress into a positive one. Take the attitude of a student, never be too big to ask questions, never know too much to learn something new. \\x0cThe reactionary is always willing to take a progressive attitude on any issue that is dead. Ability is what you\\'re capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it. Cock your hat - angles are attitudes. When you pray for anyone you tend to modify your personal attitude toward him. If you are going to achieve excellence in big things, you develop the habit in little matters. Excellence is not an exception, it is a prevailing attitude. I\\'m only going to stand before God and give an account for my life, not for somebody else\\'s life. If I have a bad attitude, then I need to say there\\'s no point in me blaming you for what\\'s wrong in my life. It is our attitude at the beginning of a difficult task which, more than anything else, will affect its successful outcome. My attitude is, if someone\\'s going to criticize me, tell me to my face. Having a positive mental attitude is asking how something can be done rather than saying it can\\'t be done. My general attitude to life is to enjoy every minute of every day. I never do anything with a feeling of, \\'Oh God, I\\'ve got to do this today.\\' A complainer is like a Death Eater because there\\'s a suction of negative energy. You can catch a great attitude from great people. The meaning of things lies not in the things themselves, but in our attitude towards them. Pink isn\\'t just a color, it\\'s an attitude! The remarkable thing is, we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. A positive attitude can really make dreams come true - it did for me. Good humor is one of the best articles of dress one can wear in society. When you are thwarted, it is your own attitude that is out of order. I think it\\'s my adventure, my trip, my journey, and I guess my attitude is, let the chips fall where they may. Bad attitudes will ruin your team. For success, attitude is equally as important as ability. \\x0cHappiness is an attitude of mind, born of the simple determination to be happy under all outward circumstances. Great effort springs naturally from great attitude. Attitudes are more important than facts. Attitude is everything. Attitude determines the altitude of life. Our attitude toward life determines life\\'s attitude towards us. The greatest discovery of my generation is that man can alter his life simply by altering his attitude of mind. But my attitude about it is I have miles to go before I sleep. The attitude is very important. Because, your behavior radiates how you feel. When you ain\\'t got no money, you gotta get an attitude. Civilization is a method of living, an attitude of equal respect for all men. Most of us start out with a positive attitude and a plan to do our best. There are no menial jobs, only menial attitudes. Funny is an attitude. The biggest challenge is how to affect public attitudes and make people care. If you don\\'t like something, change it. If you can\\'t change it, change your attitude. It is very important to generate a good attitude, a good heart, as much as possible. From this, happiness in both the short term and the long term for both yourself and others will come. Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens. Happiness doesn\\'t depend on any external conditions, it is governed by our mental attitude. Whenever you\\'re in conflict with someone, there is one factor that can make the difference between damaging your relationship and deepening it. That factor is attitude. Keep a good attitude and do the right thing even when it\\'s hard. When you do that you are passing the test. And God promises you your marked moments are on their way. \\x0cSuccess or failure depends more upon attitude than upon capacity successful men act as though they have accomplished or are enjoying something. Soon it becomes a reality. Act, look, feel successful, conduct yourself accordingly, and you will be amazed at the positive results. Like success, failure is many things to many people. With Positive Mental Attitude, failure is a learning experience, a rung on the ladder, a plateau at which to get your thoughts in order and prepare to try again. The only disability in life is a bad attitude. If you have a positive attitude and constantly strive to give your best effort, eventually you will overcome your immediate problems and find you are ready for greater challenges. You cannot control what happens to you, but you can control your attitude toward what happens to you, and in that, you will be mastering change rather than allowing it to master you. The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change his future by merely changing his attitude. A healthy attitude is contagious but don\\'t wait to catch it from others. Be a carrier. Any fact facing us is not as important as our attitude toward it, for that determines our success or failure. The way you think about a fact may defeat you before you ever do anything about it. You are overcome by the fact because you think you are. Excellence is not a skill. It is an attitude. I hope the millions of people I\\'ve touched have the optimism and desire to share their goals and hard work and persevere with a positive attitude. We cannot change our past. We can not change the fact that people act in a certain way. We can not change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I was looking for something a lot heavier, yet melodic at the same time. Something different from heavy metal, a different attitude. Spend some time this weekend on home improvement improve your attitude toward your family. \\x0cWe awaken in others the same attitude of mind we hold toward them. There is little difference in people, but that little difference makes a big difference. That little difference is attitude. The big difference is whether it is positive or negative. Ability is what you\\'re capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it. The last of human freedoms - the ability to chose one\\'s attitude in a given set of circumstances. Attitude is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than what people do or say. It is more important than appearance, giftedness, or skill. Being black is not a matter of pigmentation - being black is a reflection of a mental attitude. People in tough times - it doesn\\'t mean they don\\'t have a great attitude. A strong positive mental attitude will create more miracles than any wonder drug. Certain thoughts are prayers. There are moments when, whatever be the attitude of the body, the soul is on its knees. Leadership is practiced not so much in words as in attitude and in actions. If a person gets his attitude toward money straight, it will help straighten out almost every other area in his life. I\\'ve reached a point in my life where it\\'s the little things that matter... I was always a rebel and probably could have got much farther had I changed my attitude. But when you think about it, I got pretty far without changing attitudes. I\\'m happier with that. Fairness is not an attitude. It\\'s a professional skill that must be developed and exercised. I think whether you\\'re having setbacks or not, the role of a leader is to always display a winning attitude. Be sure what you want and be sure about yourself. Fashion is not just beauty, it\\'s about good attitude. You have to believe in yourself and be strong. \\x0cHitler and Mussolini were only the primary spokesmen for the attitude of domination and craving for power that are in the heart of almost everyone. Until the source is cleared, there will always be confusion and hate, wars and class antagonisms. There must be something solemn, serious, and tender about any attitude which we denominate religious. If glad, it must not grin or snicker if sad, it must not scream or curse. Sales are contingent upon the attitude of the salesman - not the attitude of the prospect. A positive attitude is not going to save you. What it\\'s going to do is, everyday, between now and the day you die, whether that\\'s a short time from now or a long time from now, that every day, you\\'re going to actually live. Always keep that happy attitude. Pretend that you are holding a beautiful fragrant bouquet. Black Consciousness is an attitude of the mind and a way of life, the most positive call to emanate from the black world for a long time. I think music is the greatest art form that exists, and I think people listen to music for different reasons, and it serves different purposes. Some of it is background music, and some of it is things that might affect a person\\'s day, if not their life, or change an attitude. The best songs are the ones that make you feel something. We submit to the majority because we have to. But we are not compelled to call our attitude of subjection a posture of respect. The winner\\'s edge is not in a gifted birth, a high IQ, or in talent. The winner\\'s edge is all in the attitude, not aptitude. Attitude is the criterion for success. Having a clear faith, based on the creed of the church is often labeled today as fundamentalism. Whereas relativism, which is letting oneself be tossed and swept along by every wind of teaching, look like the only attitude acceptable to today\\'s standards. Today\\'s students can put dope in their veins or hope in their brains. If they can conceive it and believe it, they can achieve it. They must know it is not their aptitude but their attitude that will determine their altitude. \\x0cI think a lot of times we don\\'t pay enough attention to people with a positive attitude because we assume they are naive or stupid or unschooled. A great attitude does much more than turn on the lights in our worlds it seems to magically connect us to all sorts of serendipitous opportunities that were somehow absent before the change. Chaotic people often have chaotic lives, and I think they create that. But if you try and have an inner peace and a positive attitude, I think you attract that. I am Classic Rock Revisited. I revisit it every waking moment of my life because it has the spirit and the attitude and the fire and the middle finger. I am Rosa Parks with a Gibson guitar. And the attitude of faith is the very opposite of clinging to belief, of holding on. Our lives are not determined by what happens to us but how we react to what happens, not by what life brings us but the attitude we bring to life. Being a sex symbol has to do with an attitude, not looks. Most men think it\\'s looks, most women know otherwise. I am responsible. Although I may not be able to prevent the worst from happening, I am responsible for my attitude toward the inevitable misfortunes that darken life. No rational argument will have a rational effect on a man who does not want to adopt a rational attitude. When I was a child I asked my mother what homosexuality was about and she said - and this was 100 years ago in Germany and she was very open-minded - \\'It\\'s like hair color. It\\'s nothing. Some people are blond and some people have dark hair. It\\'s not a subject.\\' This was a very healthy attitude. Success or failure in business is caused more by the mental attitude even than by mental capacities. Obama does not represent America. Nor does he represent anything what our forefathers stood for. This country is basically built on an attitude. It\\'s a way of life. It\\'s not because you\\'re born here. It\\'s not that you\\'re supposed to take from those who have and give to those who haven\\'t. That kills a country. It killed Russia. \\x0cStop this attitude that older people ain\\'t any good anymore! We\\'re as good as we ever were - if we ever were any good. My attitude to peace is rather based on the Burmese definition of peace - it really means removing all the negative factors that destroy peace in this world. So peace does not mean just putting an end to violence or to war, but to all other factors that threaten peace, such as discrimination, such as inequality, poverty. Your attitude is like a box of crayons that color your world. Constantly color your picture gray, and your picture will always be bleak. Try adding some bright colors to the picture by including humor, and your picture begins to lighten up. Crime is terribly revealing. Try and vary your methods as you will, your tastes, your habits, your attitude of mind, and your soul is revealed by your actions. Some people say I have attitude - maybe I do... but I think you have to. You have to believe in yourself when no one else does - that makes you a winner right there. The minute you try to talk business with him he takes the attitude that he is a gentleman and a scholar, and the moment you try to approach him on the level of his moral integrity he starts to talk business. Stiletto, I look at it more as an attitude as opposed to a high- heeled shoe. If somebody says no to you, or if you get cut, Michael Jordan was cut his first year, but he came back and he was the best ever. That is what you have to have. The attitude that I\\'m going to show everybody, I\\'m going to work hard to get better and better. When you have vision it affects your attitude. Your attitude is optimistic rather than pessimistic. What matters to me is that I do what I think is right and I see, I\\'m a numbers guy, that\\'s my attitude. I know we have a debt tsunami coming, we are bankrupting this country and I\\'m in a position where I can actually advance ideas to prevent that from happening. That\\'s exactly what I should be doing. \\x0cI developed a nutty attitude where I\\'d think, If some guy really loves me he doesn\\'t care if I\\'m fat. I\\'d come up with all these stupid reasons why it would be OK to be fat. Really you just gotta keep chugging along and keep a positive attitude and get through all the problems. You gotta face them, otherwise you don\\'t get through. Solidarity is an attitude of resistance, I suppose, or it should be. There\\'s always the motivation of wanting to win. Everybody has that. But a champion needs, in his attitude, a motivation above and beyond winning. Americans are the most generous country on the planet. I\\'ve worked in Europe, I\\'ve worked in Australia. There is no where else where you get absolutely no attitude for being a foreigner. If you do your job well, they embrace you. When I go to the clinic next and sit with a tube in my arm and watch the poison go in, I\\'m in an attitude of abject passivity. It doesn\\'t feel like fighting at all it just feels like submitting. Our judgments judge us, and nothing reveals us, exposes our weaknesses, more ingeniously than the attitude of pronouncing upon our fellows. Pessimism only describes an attitude, and not facts, and hence is entirely subjective. I was kicked out of school because of my attitude. I was not assimilating. So I went to work, taking any jobs I could get. A lot of times I find that people who are blessed with the most talent don\\'t ever develop that attitude, and the ones who aren\\'t blessed in that way are the most competitive and have the biggest heart. So long as you\\'ve got your friends about you, and a good positive attitude, you don\\'t really have to care what everyone else thinks. I separated from the Southern Baptists when they adopted the discriminatory attitude towards women, because I believe what Paul taught in Galatians that there is no distinction in God\\'s eyes between men and women, slaves and masters, Jews and non-Jews - everybody is created equally in the eyes of God. \\x0cMy attitude toward men who mess around is simple: If you find \\'em, kill \\'em. Prayer is talking with God. God knows your heart and is not so concerned with your words as He is with the attitude of your heart. You can\\'t study comedy it\\'s within you. It\\'s a personality. My humor is an attitude. You call to a dog and a dog will break its neck to get to you. Dogs just want to please. Call to a cat and its attitude is, \\'What\\'s in it for me?\\' The compulsion to do good is an innate American trait. Only North Americans seem to believe that they always should, may, and actually can choose somebody with whom to share their blessings. Ultimately this attitude leads to bombing people into the acceptance of gifts. I keep guitars that are, you know, the neck\\'s a little bit bent and it\\'s a little bit out of tune. I want to work and battle it and conquer it and make it express whatever attitude I have at that moment. I want it to be a struggle. Most of my arguments with musicians through the years have had more to do with their attitude about music, or their attitude about their own lives, or their personal responsibility. Music has never really been the big centerpiece of the fight. I love everybody. One of the great things about me is that I have a very positive attitude. Mankind\\'s true moral test, its fundamental test (which lies deeply buried from view), consists of its attitude towards those who are at its mercy: animals. And in this respect mankind has suffered a fundamental debacle, a debacle so fundamental that all others stem from it. It\\'s sort of a mental attitude about critical thinking and curiosity. It\\'s about mindset of looking at the world in a playful and curious and creative way. Punk was defined by an attitude rather than a musical style. It\\'s a fundamental, social attitude that the 1% supports symphonies and operas and doesn\\'t support Johnny learning to program hip-hop beats. When I put it like that, it sounds like, \\'Well, yeah,\\' but you start to think, \\'Why not, though?\\' What makes one more valuable than another? \\x0cI think people feel threatened by homosexuality. The problem isn\\'t about gay people, the problem is about the attitude towards gay people. People think that all gays are Hannibal Lecters. But gay people are sons and daughters, politicians and doctors, American heroes and daughters of American heroes. I have this theory that, depending on your attitude, your life doesn\\'t have to become this ridiculous charade that it seems so many people end up living. It was just like a dream. I could have ended up with an album that\\'s not all that different from anything else coming out of Nashville. Mutt made the difference. He took these songs, my attitude, my creativity, and colored them in a way that is unique. I look at Jagger and the like and if I see a good attitude I\\'ll admire it but I wouldn\\'t copy their style. My attitude is never to be satisfied, never enough, never. Today\\'s youth are told to get rich or die trying and they really shouldn\\'t take that attitude forward with them. The purely agitational attitude is not good enough for a detailed consideration of a subject. Not every religion has to have St. Augustine\\'s attitude to sex. Why even in our culture marriages are celebrated in a church, everyone present knows what is going to happen that night, but that doesn\\'t prevent it being a religious ceremony. Never refuse an assignment except when there is a conflict of interest, a potential of danger to you or your family, or you hold a strongly biased attitude about the subject under focus. We can revolutionize the attitude of inner city brown and black kids to learning. We need a civil rights movement within the African-American community. It\\'s a question of keeping one\\'s eyes and ears open and watching how other people play the game. They\\'re watching me too, to see what my attitude is like. Yes, we\\'re still five little people with a noisy attitude. \\x0cIn individual industries where female labour pays an important role, any movement advocating better wages, shorter working hours, etc., would not be doomed from the start because of the attitude of those women workers who are not organized. On \\'Van Halen,\\' I was a young punk, and everything revolved around the fastest kid in town, gunslinger attitude. But I\\'d say that at the time of \\'Fair Warning,\\' I started concentrating more on songwriting. But I guess in most people\\'s minds I\\'m just a gunslinger. Design is about point of view, and there should be some sort of woman or lifestyle or attitude in one\\'s head as a designer. Liberalism is an attitude rather than a set of dogmas - an attitude that insists upon questioning all plausible and self-evident propositions, seeking not to reject them but to find out what evidence there is to support them rather than their possible alternatives. The Dolls were an attitude. If nothing else they were a great attitude. I was impressed by Hendrix. His attitude was brilliant. Even the way he walked was amazing. The best way to inspire people to superior performance is to convince them by everything you do and by your everyday attitude that you are wholeheartedly supporting them. I think it\\'s your mental attitude. So many of us start dreading age in high school and that\\'s a waste of a lovely life. \\'Oh... I\\'m 30, oh, I\\'m 40, oh, 50.\\' Make the most of it. The attitude that nature is chaotic and that the artist puts order into it is a very absurd point of view, I think. All that we can hope for is to put some order into ourselves. Britishness is just a way of putting things together and a certain don\\'t care attitude about clothes. You don\\'t care, you just do it and it looks great. It remains to consider what attitude thoughtful men and Christian believers should take respecting them, and how they stand related to beliefs of another order. Surfers have the most attitude. \\x0cI\\'ve never run into a guy who could win at the top level in anything today and didn\\'t have the right attitude, didn\\'t give it everything he had, at least while he was doing it wasn\\'t prepared and didn\\'t have the whole program worked out. That\\'s what I love from metal, and that\\'s what I love from hip-hop. That\\'s what I love from any music that\\'s hard, that\\'s got an edge to it-The attitude in it. That attitude that fighting is probably not fair, but you have to defend yourself anyway and damage the enemy, has been profoundly consequential as far as my political activism goes. Seek out that particular mental attribute which makes you feel most deeply and vitally alive, along with which comes the inner voice which says, \\'This is the real me,\\' and when you have found that attitude, follow it. People think, \\'She\\'s a model. She must have such an attitude. She must be so stuck up.\\' But I\\'m normal. I cry. I\\'m not rich. I drive a 1987 Chevrolet Celebrity. My grandfather was a man, when he talked about freedom, his attitude was really interesting. His view was that you had obligations or you had responsibilities, and when you fulfilled those obligations or responsibilities, that then gave you the liberty to do other things. I think failure is nothing more than life\\'s way of nudging you that you are off course. My attitude to failure is not attached to outcome, but in not trying. It is liberating. Most people attach failure to something not working out or how people perceive you. This way, it is about answering to yourself. Part of our western outlook stems from the scientific attitude and its method of isolating the parts of a phenomenon in order to analyze them.  There is a single thread of attitude, a single direction of flow, that joins our present time to its early burgeoning in Mediterranean civilization. We live in a country that used to have a can-do attitude, and now we have a \\'what-can-you- do-for-me?\\' attitude, and what I try to do is find ways that we can develop common ground. \\x0cCould we change our attitude, we should not only see life differently, but life itself would come to be different. The ideal attitude is to be physically loose and mentally tight. An attitude to life which seeks fulfillment in the single-minded pursuit of wealth - in short, materialism - does not fit into this world, because it contains within itself no limiting principle, while the environment in which it is placed is strictly limited. You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it. What was past was past. I suppose that was the general attitude. Iraq is just a symbol of the attitude of western democracies to the rest of the world. I don\\'t mean this in a stuck-up way, but I needed an attitude song. I met my grandfather just before he died, and it was the first time that I had seen Dad with a relative of his. It was interesting to see my own father as a son and the body language and alteration in attitude that comes with that, and it sort of changed our relationship for the better. I don\\'t think it\\'s a good attitude in your life to feel that you have to be rich to have self- esteem. All we need, really, is a change from a near frigid to a tropical attitude of mind. An aristocratic culture does not advertise its emotions. In its forms of expression it is sober and reserved. Its general attitude is stoic. I was impressed by Hendrix. Not so much by his playing, as his attitude - he wasn\\'t a great player, but everything else about him was brilliant. Attitude is attitude, whether you\\'re a West Coast gangster or East Coast gangster, you know? You know, I always say white is not a colour, white is an attitude, and if you haven\\'t got trillions of dollars in the bank that you don\\'t need, you can\\'t be white.  Being a part of SKECHERS is exciting. It is such a hip company with a great attitude and image. \\x0cIt is precisely the purpose of the public opinion generated by the press to make the public incapable of judging, to insinuate into it the attitude of someone irresponsible, uninformed. Coaches will eventually notice a great attitude, and they respect that. The novelist teaches the reader to comprehend the world as a question. There is wisdom and tolerance in that attitude. In a world built on sacrosanct certainties the novel is dead. No one\\'s going to be able to operate without a grounding in the basic sciences. Language would be helpful, although English is becoming increasingly international. And travel. You have to have a global attitude. My second husband believed I had such a fickle attitude to friendship that each Friday he would update the list of my \\'Top Ten\\' friends in the manner of a Top Of The Pops chart countdown. If you can kill animals, the same attitude can kill human beings. The mentality is the same which exploits nature and which creates wars. My attitude is, do as much as I can while I\\'m free. And if I\\'m arrested I\\'ll still do as much as I can. There are a lot of movies I\\'d like to throw away. That\\'s not to say that I went in with that attitude. Any film I ever started, I went in with all the hope and best intentions in the world, but some films just don\\'t work. By making a comeback, I\\'m changing the attitude of people toward me. If I\\'d known that people would react so enthusiastically, I\\'d have done it years ago. Today, I think the attitude is that governing is not necessarily good politics, and the result is that it\\'s much more partisan and much more divided. That term\\'s definitely got a negative aura to it, because people think a diva is somebody with an attitude who demands things all the time. Of course there is that type of diva, but my idea of a diva has always been a singer - whether male or female - who gets on that stage and captivates you with their presence and their voice. \\x0cOh, I don\\'t think Tom Sowell would tell anybody to join the administration. That\\'s not his style. But I think his attitude has always been if it had to be done he\\'d prefer me to do it than somebody else. The Senator from Massachusetts has given us ample grounds to doubt the judgment and the attitude he brings to bear on vital issues of national security. I perfectly understood President Obama\\'s attitude throughout the French presidential campaign. He had no reason to distance himself from Nicolas Sarkozy. It\\'s the basic solidarity that leaders who worked together owe to each other. I think it has something to do with being British. We don\\'t take ourselves as seriously as some other countries do. I think a lot of people take themselves far too seriously I find that a very tedious attitude. I failed the LSAT. Basically, if I had not failed, I\\'d have been a lawyer and there would be no Spanx. I think failure is nothing more than life\\'s way of nudging you that you are off course. My attitude to failure is not attached to outcome, but in not trying. It is liberating. My attitude to writing is like when you do wallpapering, you remember where all the little bits are that don\\'t meet. And then your friends say: It\\'s terrific! Liberalism is a really old British tradition and it has a completely different attitude towards the individual and the relationship between the individual and the state than the collectivist response of Labour, and particularly Old Labour, does. I\\'ve always had a \\'Work hard, play hard\\' attitude to life - I still do - but sometimes you get involved in something that needs a calm, methodical approach. I\\'ve always considered myself to be fiercely patriotic. I love Britain - its history and the down-to-earth attitude people have. There is a brief moment when all there is in a man\\'s mind and soul and spirit is reflected through his eyes, his hands, his attitude. This is the moment to record. \\x0cI was fortunate to play for Pete Rose and have teammates like Ken Griffey Sr., Tony Perez and Dave Concepcion. I grew up in the game with a mature attitude. I\\'ve always known it was better to be seen and not heard. I\\'ve never been out with any of the cast of Coronation Street. We\\'re all very close friends so it\\'s very much a professional attitude. Nothing. We\\'re all friends and friendly. So when the cameras go down, depending on the mood or the nature of the material we\\'re dealing with, there\\'s usually a kind of a prevailing light attitude that\\'s floating around. I will keep smiling, be positive and never give up! I will give 100 percent each time I play. These are always my goals and my attitude. I\\'m taking a bit of a wait-and- see attitude towards 3D. My father instilled in me the attitude of prevailing. If there\\'s a challenge, go for it. If there\\'s a wall to break down, break it down. Just as the left has to be more willing to question \\'Government knows best,\\' the right has to rethink its laissez- faire attitude toward government. The attitude of insolent haughtiness is characteristic of the relationships Americans form with what is alien to them, with others. Although as a sailor I despised politics - for I loved my sailor\\'s life and still love it today - conditions forced me to take up a definite attitude towards political problems. How do you nurture a positive attitude when all the statistics say you\\'re a dead man? You go to work. The pilot looked at his cues of attitude and speed and orientation and so on and responded as he would from the same cues in an airplane, but there was no way it flew the same. The simulators had showed us that. It was my father who instilled the \\'never say no\\' attitude I carry around with me today, and who instilled in me a sense of wonder, always taking us on adventures in the car, never telling us the destination. \\x0cI went to England in the \\'70s, and I was in my early 20s. There was still a residue of that era of being an underclass or colonial. I assume it must have been a more aggressive and prominent attitude 40 years before that, because Australia internationally wasn\\'t regarded as having much cultural value. We were a country full of sheep and convicts. For a writer only one form of patriotism exists: his attitude toward language. Gardening is not trivial. If you believe that it is, closely examine why you feel that way. You may discover that this attitude has been forced upon you by mass media and the crass culture it creates and maintains. The fact is, gardening is just the opposite - it is, or should be, a central, basic expression of human life. Becoming an author changes your attitude too. Once you see where books come from, and how they\\'re made, they never seem quite as sacred again. I was bringing my attitude as a regular person \\'cause this is my attitude. If you can attribute your success entirely to your own mental effort, to your own attitude, to some spiritual essence that you have that is better than other people\\'s, then that must feel pretty good. I fell in love with Erica Kane the summer before my freshman year of high school. Like all red-blooded teen American boys, I\\'d come home from water polo practice and eat a box of Entenmann\\'s Pop\\'Ems donut holes in front of the TV while obsessively fawning over \\'All My Children\\' and Erica, her clothes, and her narcissistic attitude. Films for TV have to be much closer to the book, mainly because the objective with a TV movie that translates literature is to get the audience, after seeing this version, to pick up the book and read it themselves. My attitude is that TV can never really be any form of art, because it serves audience expectations. You can\\'t beat the beehive for glam punkette attitude. \\x0cI haven\\'t seen Clones, which has been during this period when I haven\\'t seen much of anything, but I did see Phantom Menace, and see my feelings about it - see, first of all, I think that when you make a lot of movies, your attitude about the movies changes. My attitude is always one of sensuality, aggressive enthusiasm and a kind of outrageousness in my expression. Epic poetry exhibits life in some great symbolic attitude. It cannot strictly be said to symbolize life itself, but always some manner of life. When you retire, it\\'s a place in life, a part of the journey. You just don\\'t quit work you develop an attitude where you can do what you please. When a parent shows up with an attitude of entitlement, understand that under it is a boatload of anxiety. What reader wants to be told what attitude to strike? My denial and irresponsible attitude about asthma put me at great risk and caused me so much needless suffering. My hope is that the kids I talk to learn to open up about their asthma, become educated about their condition, and seek help. Woman must have her freedom, the fundamental freedom of choosing whether or not she will be a mother and how many children she will have. Regardless of what man\\'s attitude may be, that problem is hers - and before it can be his, it is hers alone. Even as a little child, I\\'ve always had that comedian kind of attitude. I mean, the shoe - there is a music to it, there is attitude, there is sound, it\\'s a movement. Clothes - it\\'s a different story. There are a million things I\\'d rather do before designing clothes: directing, landscaping. In just the same way the thousands of successive positions of a runner are contracted into one sole symbolic attitude, which our eye perceives, which art reproduces, and which becomes for everyone the image of a man who runs. In the late \\'70s, maybe just before I started, there was still an attitude that if you did film you didn\\'t do TV and vice versa, but that\\'s gone now. \\x0cI cannot say that the attitude of the United Nations always is for the Israeli attitude. Israel, I think, has been under severe attacks by members of the United Nations many times. I love her attitude, but as much as I\\'d like to bring my medals to a speech or appearance, I never do. We must advertise to U.S. business that we are there, that our attitude has changed, and that we care. When we are asked to help, we have to perform and provide the right advice. The American attitude towards efficiency and execution should always underlie architecture. I have such an extreme attitude about work, where I can just completely be derelict of my responsibilities and then when I am not derelict, I am completely indulged in it. I swing pretty wildly from the two extremes. I have a political attitude, but I\\'m certainly not a politician. I think my attitude to human beings has changed since leaving prison. I went to the Performing Arts School and studied classical ballet. That attitude is something that\\'s put into your head. You are never thin enough. I have always detested any departure from reality, an attitude which I relate to my mother\\'s poor mental health. With just about every player in Australia, his whole goal and ambition is to play for Australia. That\\'s why they\\'re playing first class cricket. It\\'s just a different attitude. Right after \\'Raymond\\' I had a world-is-my-oyster attitude, but I found out I don\\'t like oysters. I had this existential emptiness. \\'What is my purpose? Who am I?\\' I had a big identity crisis. What sculptors do is represent the essence of gesture. What is important in mime is attitude. It really was hand-to-mouth and you can say, \\'Poor little me, how dreadful, what a deprived childhood\\', but I didn\\'t feel that way at all. It\\'s all about the attitude at home. \\x0cHaving a clear faith, based on the creed of the church is often labeled today as fundamentalism. Whereas relativism, which is letting oneself be tossed and swept along by every wind of teaching, look like the only attitude acceptable to today\\'s standards. You know what\\'s funny to me? Attitude. The characteristic political attitude of today is not one of positive belief, but of despair. If you can\\'t change your fate, change your attitude. Mainly what I learned from Buddy... was an attitude. He loved music, and he taught me that it shouldn\\'t have any barriers to it. I think fun is an important part of the entertainment industry, and it should be. Anybody who\\'s not incorporating some of that into their work needs to take a break, go away, and have an attitude adjustment. I have played on many teams throughout my career, and I know when a team has the tools, and the right positive attitude towards winning. Vampires are so old that they don\\'t need to impress anyone anymore. They\\'re comfortable in their own skin. It\\'s this enigmatic strength that\\'s very romantic and old-fashioned. I think it goes back to something of a Victorian attitude of finding a strong man who\\'s going to look after his woman. What I wish I had, is that I wish I was a little more Greek, in that I wish I could lose my North American driven attitude and that I could be a little bit more poetic and laissez faire. I was always the guy getting kicked out of my classes at school for having an attitude problem. And I tell you, having girls has made me a much better man. I have friends who are fathers, but they only have boys, and they have the same attitude toward women they always had, you know? And I don\\'t play that... My girls, you mess with them? I will bury you underground. Style is a reflection of your attitude and your personality. If a person can be said to have the wrong attitude, there is no need to pay attention to his arguments. The attitude is we live and let live. This is actually an amazing change in values in a rather short time and it\\'s an example of freedom from religion. \\x0cNot to discriminate every moment some passionate attitude in those about us, and in the very brilliancy of their gifts some tragic dividing on their ways, is, on this short day of frost and sun, to sleep before evening. Players should know that if you can\\'t make the contribution of the winning shot, that your attitude every day when you come to practice, or the positive contribution you make through cheering and keeping up team morale, is just as important in the overall picture. It\\'s not the style that motivates me, as much as an attitude of openness that I have when I go into a project. The place of chess in the society is closely related to the attitude of young people towards our game. We assume that we\\'ve come so far as compassionate citizens of the world if we do choose to read the news, yet the attitude towards life can be one where we put blinders on and forget that there are civil wars going on. It\\'s easy to forget that there are so many people starving to death every single day. The jokes are great but what really matters for a comedian is his performance, his whole attitude, and the laughs that he gets between the jokes rather than on top of the jokes. There were a few teachers who just did not like me because of my face. Once, I was told to stand in the corner until I cheered up. The attitude was, \\'Oh, for God\\'s sake, what\\'s the matter with him?\\' But it\\'s just a natural expression. I\\'m just part of a tradition of people who aren\\'t pleased. I would never think anyone else who has the same attitude was getting it from me. I\\'d just think they\\'re... sensible. The key to life is your attitude. Whether you\\'re single or married or have kids or don\\'t have kids, it\\'s how you look at your life, what you make of it. It\\'s about making the best of your life wherever you are in life. If you get a diagnosis, get on a therapy, keep a good attitude and keep your sense of humor. When a woman puts on a heel, she has a different posture, a different attitude. She really stands up and has a consciousness of her body. \\x0cWhenever I\\'m having a bad day and have an attitude, I stay home. I keep it at home. You don\\'t have to have an attitude if you\\'re famous. I need that aggressive attitude to play my music and more men have that attitude than women. But Jesus changes your attitude towards yourself and towards other people. But I think bands that rolled in with a big attitude, like they were some big deal, I just found that very strange. What irritates me is the bland way people go around saying, \\'Oh, our attitude has changed. We don\\'t dislike these people any more.\\' But by the strangest coincidence, they haven\\'t taken away the injustice the laws are still on the books. There is definitely something sexy about a girl with an attitude and a pair of leather pants. The phenomenon of home schooling is a wonderful example of the American can- do attitude. Growing numbers of parents have become disenchanted with government-run public schools. Many parents have simply taken matters into their own hands, literally. Regardless of what one\\'s attitude towards prohibition may be, temperance is something against which, at a time of war, no reasonable protest can be made. At home in Ireland, there\\'s a habit of avoidance, an ironical attitude towards the authority figure. Even if people do wrong, we\\'re social animals, so what can we do about stopping them doing the same things in future? Saying people are \\'bad\\' or \\'evil\\' is just an unwillingness to engage an unwillingness to try to empathise. That sanctimonious attitude doesn\\'t help anyone. People have often asked if I\\'m gay because I don\\'t go out of my way to spit and scratch and give people attitude. I don\\'t return anybody\\'s calls unless it\\'s going to mean extra money for me. And I\\'ve completely cut off all relationships with any friends that I had before the show. And I\\'ve copped an attitude. A positive attitude is something everyone can work on, and everyone can learn how to employ it. \\x0cMy feelings about my mortality are less selfish than they used to be. I used to affect a cavalier attitude to death now I see it from my son\\'s perspective. The U.S. tries to provide immigrants who grow up here with a world-class education and imbue them with the can- do attitude that has long defined American innovation. The attitude of independence toward a constructed language which all national speakers must adopt is really a great advantage, because it tends to make man see himself as the master of language instead of its obedient servant. I feel like I have as good a shot as anybody out there and I have gotten close in the past, so why not have the attitude that I can come out and play great tennis and maybe even win this tournament. Art is the child of Nature yes, her darling child, in whom we trace the features of the mother\\'s face, her aspect and her attitude. I just think that people take me a little more seriously as a brunette. I don\\'t know if that\\'s just because of a societal preconceived notion that all blondes are stupid, but it\\'s a different kind of attitude. I came back to performing with a different attitude about performing and myself. I wasn\\'t expecting perfection any more, just hoping for an occasional inspiration. The purely agitation attitude is not good enough for a detailed consideration of a subject. Animals have a much better attitude to life and death than we do. They know when their time has come. We are the ones that suffer when they pass, but it\\'s a healing kind of grief that enables us to deal with other griefs that are not so easy to grab hold of. Only one thing can conquer war - that attitude of mind which can see nothing in war but destruction and annihilation. It\\'s not too good to have this attitude in F1. It could be a disadvantage. I just really think every job I do, I get this gypsy attitude to money. \\x0cMy personal view is that such total planning by the state is an absolute good and not simply a relative good... I do not myself think of the attitude I take as deriving from Marx - though this undoubtedly will be suggested - but from Fichte and Hegel. There\\'s a punk-rock attitude, clearly, to \\'Hated.\\' There\\'s even a punk-rock attitude to \\'The Hangover,\\' I think. We start the movie with a Glenn Danzig song. The American attitude is \\'We\\'re the best\\'. That\\'s why the NBA guys who come from other countries, the Europeans, all sort of stick together away from the game. The problem was just a mean attitude that festers and has to be challenged. I\\'m not anti-fashion, but I\\'ve always had a bit of a punk attitude. That\\'s important, I think. I do my own thing. To so enter into it in nature and art that the enjoyed meanings of life may become a part of living is the attitude of aesthetic appreciation. The traditional Christian attitude toward human personality was that human nature was essentially good and that it was formed and modified by social pressures and training. My parents have a strong work ethic, but their attitude to life, their philosophy, is: \\'whatever makes you happy.\\' Bob Altman had this relaxed but serious attitude. Everybody loved him. I wanted him to adopt me. The pool is terrible, but that doesn\\'t have much to do with my record swims. That\\'s all mental attitude. Fame can be just so annoying because people are so critical of you. You can\\'t just say, \\'hi\\'. You say hi and people whisper\\' man did you see the way she said hi? What an attitude. My dad instilled in me a great sense of humor. I wasn\\'t bullied at school because my outward attitude was confident, and that helps. The attitude and capacity of the factory, the old metal table and the new ideas of the wooden furniture quickly and naturally suggested the possibility of metal furniture. You can measure a programmer\\'s perspective by noting his attitude on the continuing vitality of FORTRAN. \\x0cLet us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs. Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do. It goes without saying that the Jewish people can have no other goal than Palestine and that, whatever the fate of the proposition may be, our attitude toward the land of our fathers is and shall remain unchangeable. That attitude toward women as objects may have worked for the late Sixties, but it doesn\\'t do so now. The time I spent thinking about how I was better than somebody else or worrying about somebody else\\'s attitude was time I could put to better use. I really believe you can predict when someone has a great attitude, a real well of talent. It is impossible to exaggerate the wide, and widening, gulf between the American attitude on the Iraq war and the view from our friends across the Atlantic. As a team, you need to come from behind every once in awhile just to do it. Good for the attitude. It makes it exciting. And when everybody knows you have to throw it... that makes it fun too. I hope \\'The Voice\\' has a fifteen-year run, don\\'t get me wrong. But I come from nothing, and maybe it\\'s the Irish in me, but my attitude is always like, \\'They\\'ll figure me out soon.\\' Time plays a role in almost every decision. And some decisions define your attitude about time. UFO\\'s\\' attitude toward the subject is very similar to mine. It\\'s not an advocacy its philosophy is more \\'I want to believe this, but I want it proved. The music is first and foremost everything - no egos, no attitude, nothing - it\\'s about the music. But having said that, there\\'s also a sea change in attitude towards media. In the West, you have always associated the Islamic faith 100 percent with Arab culture. This in itself is a fundamentalist attitude and it is mistaken. \\x0cJazz in itself is not struggling. That is, the music itself is not struggling... It\\'s the attitude that\\'s in trouble. My plays insist that we should not forget or toss away our history. As the time goes by, you change, your learn new things, your attitude is different. For the moment, I\\'m still enjoying ski racing so much that it would be difficult for me to think about ending my career. My attitude on skis is different now. I have learned to put less pressure on myself and on the edges of my skis when I\\'m racing, to be keep myself more under control. Our attitude is that we want to cross over. You can\\'t go on making records just for your own hometown. I do not share the half-in, half- out attitude to the EU of some in Britain. Britain\\'s place is in Europe. I think that the U.S. does have this very much more open attitude, and I admire it very much and I think it\\'s very important to the world. But the information and the discussion sometimes come too late, after the effective decision has been made. The Stones are a different kind of group. I realized that when I joined them. It\\'s not really so much their musical ability, it\\'s just they have a certain kind of style and attitude which is unique. Even with, or perhaps, because of, this background, I have over the past few years sensed a very dramatic change in attitude on the part of Prince Edward Islanders towards the on-going rush for so-called modernization. If you\\'re looking for can-do, earthy-crunchy attitude then you\\'ve got to go to Wisconsin. When I was in my 20s it did occur to me that there was something perverted about an attitude that thought that killing somebody was a minor offence compared to kissing somebody. You can have a laugh in Los Angeles, or you can weep in Los Angeles, depending on your attitude towards it. People are patronizing the theatres with renewed enthusiasm - there is an entire picnic-like attitude when families go out to see movies, which is a very good sign. They want to see larger-than- life characters on the big screen and not just watch movies on television or on DVDs. \\x0cI just want to go in with the right attitude and from Day 1 make a difference. The theatre only knows what it\\'s doing next week, not like the opera, where they say: What are we going to do in five years\\' time? A completely different attitude. I\\'m not a music lover in the sense that I look for something to have on. I\\'ve never had that attitude to music. I think one of the things that language poets are very involved with is getting away from conventional ideas of beauty, because those ideas contain a certain attitude toward women, certain attitudes toward sex, certain attitudes toward race, etc. When you Google me, you\\'ll find a lot of people don\\'t like Richard Dreyfuss. Because I\\'m cocky and I present a cocky attitude. But no one has ever disagreed with the notion I represent, that we need more civic education. So far there\\'s 100 percent support for that. My mother, she had a very good attitude toward money. I\\'m very grateful for the fact that we had to learn to save. I used to get like 50 pence a week, and I\\'d save it for like five months. And then I\\'d spend it on Christmas presents. I\\'d save up like eight pounds. It\\'s nothing, but we did that. Too many people say to their brokers, I can\\'t deal with this. Take my money. Do what you want. That\\'s the worst attitude you can have. If philosophy is practice, a demand to know the manner in which its history is to be studied is entailed: a theoretical attitude toward it becomes real only in the living appropriation of its contents from the texts. I am shocked by the easy attitude of many in the media towards disclosing our Nation\\'s secrets. I always give Lindsay so much credit for her tennis game, for her attitude, for her person, and because of how she deals with all the things. I don\\'t think people give her enough credit for how well she\\'s doing. I don\\'t know that I have any role models now that are fixed. Definitely my mom - she\\'s the coolest. She\\'s worked really hard her whole life and I just think she\\'s got a great attitude. Moms just know so much it\\'s so silly. \\x0cIt\\'s tricky. I\\'ve never been standing at the top of the tree with tons of money thrown at me. I\\'ve never really had a profile. So in a way I have this \\'nothing to lose\\' attitude. Lead singers not only do the majority of the work, but their personalities are singled out and taken as the general attitude of the unit. It\\'s better for me to play with guys because Rock \\'n\\' Roll has such an aggressive attitude. I think Nina Simone has had an amazing journey. She was spicy and she had attitude and she didn\\'t care, she wanted her money in a paper bag and don\\'t mess with me and I\\'ve been doing some research on that so. I kind of resent this attitude of men that we somehow must always look good. Bambi can\\'t act. Bambi had major attitude. I\\'m a big fan of Courtney Love. I love Hole and I love her acting and I love her attitude. I just hope I never meet her in a dark alley. I do support a sex-positive attitude for young people. Use condoms, that\\'s important. I love the idea that promiscuity can be healthy but it\\'s got some dodgy crevasses. Ooh, that\\'s a bad reference! But it\\'s got some dangerous cavities there. You know what I\\'m saying. The war changed everybody\\'s attitude. We became international almost overnight. As I wrote, I found that Aibileen had some things to say that really weren\\'t in her character. She was older, soft-spoken, and she started showing some attitude. I like England more than I did when I left. It\\'s become a bit of a better country in the last ten years, in the attitude of it. A bit more Americanized, which is both good and bad. At least when you order a cup of coffee they don\\'t give you a hard time. What a stupid attitude we have in this country to personal stories. I have a Woody Allen Jewish attitude to life: that it\\'s all going to be disastrous. That it hasn\\'t all been that way is simply down to some random quirk of fate. My attitude toward graduate students was different, I must say. I used graduate students as colleagues: I gave them the best problems to work on, and I encouraged them. \\x0cTommie Aaron taught me how to have a good attitude, to be easy going and not get uptight. In aid, the proper attitude is one omitting gratitude. In Scotland over many years we have cultivated through our justice system what I hope can be described as a \\'culture of compassion.\\' On the other hand, there still exists in many parts of the U.S., if not nationally, an attitude towards the concept of justice which can only be described as a \\'culture of vengeance.\\' Any time I need to get a serious attitude adjustment, I put on one of their records, and there are examples there for all time to keep us honest and keep us reaching they\\'ll never be eclipsed. I always had the attitude that I wanted to throw a no-hitter every game. I like actors that are good with pantomime and that can transmit a lot by their presence and attitude more than through their dialogue. Having a child makes you strong and gives you chutzpah. It relaxed my attitude to the job my center of focus shifted, which I think is very helpful, because even if you\\'re not a very indulgent actor you spend a lot of time thinking about yourself. I don\\'t think that is particularly healthy. I always said punk was an attitude. It was never about having a Mohican haircut or wearing a ripped T-shirt. It was all about destruction, and the creative potential within that. Sid Vicious began the age of participation in which everyone could be the artist. Sid proved that you don\\'t have to play well to be the star. You can play badly, or not even at all. I endorsed that attitude. If you can\\'t write songs, no problem - simply steal one and change it to your taste. Abhorrence of apartheid is a moral attitude, not a policy. Every baseball crowd, like every theatre audience, has its own distinctive attitude and atmosphere. Football is my profession now. I\\'m getting married in August... It\\'s a new experience for me as someone just getting out of college. I still have the same attitude about football I always had. I play hard. I enjoy practice. I\\'d rather be throwing in passing drills than sitting around and watching TV. \\x0cThe attitude we have towards our personal pets as opposed to the animals that suffer under the factory farm is hypocritical and delusional. Certain kinds of speed, flow, intensity, density of attacks, density of interaction... Music that concentrates on those qualities is, I think, easier achieved by free improvisation between people sharing a common attitude, a common language. I saw \\'Taxi Driver,\\' and \\'Taxi Driver\\' kind of saved my life. The scene where Robert De Niro is looking at himself in the mirror saying, \\'You talkin\\' to me? You talkin\\' to me? Who the hell else are you talkin\\' to?\\' That\\'s the scene that changed my life by changing my attitude about acting. I\\'ve always been a guy who\\'s pretty supportive, its just my nature, so I came in to the situation with the attitude that I wanted to support Johnny and make it work. I thought I was going to be killed. The casualties were so heavy, it was just a given. I learned to take each day, each mission, as it came. That\\'s an attitude I\\'ve carried into my professional life. I take each case, each job, as it comes. What has happened is that to some degree they have taken an attitude where they don\\'t listen to demos of diverse subject matters. They\\'re looking for demos like the record the guy on the left just did. Here you do have forests, where pigs could be raised by letting them root about in the forests for a good part of the year. Therefore, you have a different attitude toward them compared with what continues to exist in the Middle East. The attitude of physiological psychology to sensations and feelings, considered as psychical elements, is, naturally, the attitude of psychology at large. This generation... they have a different attitude. Instead of sitting and watching something, they want to be a part of it - they\\'re very hedonistic and sensual. We have become aware of the responsibility for our attitude towards the dark pages in our history. We have understood that bad service is done to the nation by those who are impelling to renounce that past. \\x0cBut I do think that we approach music, in of itself, with a religious attitude. I think that generally music should be a positive thing, I like Bob Marley\\'s attitude: he said that his goal in life was to single handedly fight all the evil in the world with nothing but music, and when he went to a place he didn\\'t go to play, he went to conquer. In 1977, at least, he wished to have people believe that he shared and was proud of an attitude toward women that is not acceptable in a politician. In 2003, all he has said is that he doesn\\'t remember the interview. You\\'d like more people to recognise what you do is special. But I take the attitude that the best thing I can do for my sport is to be the best at it. The best way people will come to recognise that track and field is a great sport is to see athletes excelling at it. Which is what I intend to do. So at a time in which the media give the public everything it wants and desires, maybe art should adopt a much more aggressive attitude towards the public. I myself am very much inclined to take this position. Modern Orthodoxy has a highly positive attitude toward the State of Israel. Our Ultra- Orthodox brethren recognize only the Holy Land, but not the state. I just try to try to keep an attitude that I don\\'t know what I\\'m doing. Not to the point where I\\'m beating myself up, but I just go in thinking that I have a lot to learn. And I hope I still have that attitude 30 years from now. I\\'m not going to take this defeatist attitude and listen to all this crap any more from all these people who have nothing except doomsday to predict. A series of rumors about my attitude, as well as derogatory remarks about myself and my family showed me that the personal resentment of the Detroit general manager toward me would make it impossible for me to continue playing hockey in Detroit.  Before \\'Gangnam Style\\' I was not a good attitude artist. \\x0cWomen didn\\'t want to be on the stage with other women because they didn\\'t want their bodies to be compared. They didn\\'t want another female act opening for them because of this weird competitive and tokenistic attitude. Listen, whatever makes the movie better. That\\'s the attitude you have to have. Reason is an action of the mind knowledge is a possession of the mind but faith is an attitude of the person. It means you are prepared to stake yourself on something being so. Hardboiled crime fiction came of age in \\'Black Mask\\' magazine during the Twenties and Thirties. Writers like Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler learnt their craft and developed a distinct literary style and attitude toward the modern world. I don\\'t think people are fools, and I think they deserve a good attitude and smart entertainment. Hollywood\\'s a very weird place. I think there\\'s less of everything except for attitude. My agent says that I\\'m a \\'repeat business guy.\\' If you hire me to come do a movie, I\\'ll be on time, know all my material, be ready to go, have a good attitude. I\\'m here to work, so I get hired over and over again by the same producers. If you just be a team player on set you can work so much more often. What do you mean by faith? Is faith enough for Man? Should he be satisfied with faith alone? Is there no way of finding out the truth? Is the attitude of faith, of believing in something for which there can be no more than philosophic proof, the true mark of a Christian? I still have a young attitude. Elvis Costello had a brand new bag. He was a musician, but he knew all about the attitude part of it. The world is full of musicians who can play great, and you wouldn\\'t cross the road to see them. It\\'s people who have this indefinable attitude that are the good ones. After working for years in Hollywood where the actors have taken over, it was a real relief to get down there and not only have some children, but also have some actors that had no attitude. \\x0cWhen you are facing the wilderness on your own, you have a totally different attitude to someone who works in government or who has a monthly cheque. If you take the contempt some Americans have for yuppies and multiply it by 10 you might come close to understanding their attitude towards the City, as they call it - London, the people of the south. If you go on stage with the wrong attitude, or something in your performance is off, you can lose an audience in the first minute. That first minute is crucial. We can do better in higher education. And it is more than just technology. It\\'s also an attitude on the part of faculty. We need to think through how we can produce a better quality product at less cost. In terms of work I\\'ve always had a Bad Attitude in that I won\\'t work anywhere which requires me to work strict hours or follow a dress code. I don\\'t know if that\\'s an Asperger\\'s thing or not, I think it\\'s just being reasonable. Attitude is your acceptance of the natural laws, or your rejection of the natural laws. Look, everything that you experience as a kid is the foundation of how you are today. I was brought up in a working class family in Leeds and when it comes to money both my parents worked hard and instilled the same attitude into me. With my talent, I can make people laugh and give them another attitude about life. What a blessing that is for me. Acting is magical. Change your look and your attitude, and you can be anyone. When I first left university, I thought about going into the private sector. But I discovered when I went to interview that I could only have a career in the back office, or doing HR. The attitude was, \\'My dear lady, you cannot possibly think about going on the board.\\' It got very tedious saying the same jokes in the same way with the same attitude. In regard to music, I just think that it\\'s always best to have an attitude of being a perpetual student and always look to learn something new about music, because there\\'s always something new to learn. \\x0cCanadians tend to be a bit more religious than most Europeans - though not more than the Poles or Ukrainians. Most important, their attitude to immigration and ethnic minorities is more positive than that of most Europeans. The townspeople outside the reservations had a very superior attitude toward Indians, which was kind of funny, because they weren\\'t very wealthy they were on the fringes of society themselves. The money is in a different league these days, of course, but I have special memories of the 60s and 70s which players today don\\'t have. There wasn\\'t the same celebrity attitude and media exposure. We had a bit more freedom. My attitude about Hollywood is that I wouldn\\'t walk across the street to pull one of those executives out of the snow if he was bleeding to death. Not unless I was paid for it. None of them ever did me any favors. All ideas come about through some sort of observation. It sparks an attitude some object or emotion causes a reaction in the other person. There are a lot of female artists my age around at the moment, but they\\'re all American and blonde and blue-eyed and smiley. I\\'m totally the opposite of that. I want to show a bit more attitude and I have an opinion. I try and have a relaxed attitude and stay quite switched off until about an hour before kick-off. I think it has other roots, has to do, in part, with a general anxiety in contemporary life... nuclear bombs, inequality of possibility and chance, inequality of goods allotted to us, a kind of general racist, unjust attitude that is pervasive. There has been a change in attitude, though. I want to work with kids and help develop them, show them the right way, the right morals and attitude into how to become a better footballer. Australia has many different cultures but I\\'d like to bring in the indigenous style, bring their competitiveness, athleticism and raw ability into the frame. There is no planning. On the night it is really great, it\\'s euphoria and if it is not so great there is always tomorrow night. That was his attitude. \\x0cMy grandmother is this amazingly theatrical woman. She acted like a movie star, as far as looks and attitude, kind of like Susan Hayward. If I don\\'t make the team out of spring training, I\\'ll keep a good attitude. I\\'ll just go polish up the parts of my game that made me not stay in the big leagues. If a site is done with pleasure and a fun attitude, it\\'s a great way to communicate with your fans. I know a lot of Eastern Europeans, and because of what they have been through and what they have seen, they have an attitude where they are not easily fooled. I always have one or two, sometimes more, Navajo or other tribes\\' cultural elements in mind when I start a plot. In Thief of Time, I wanted to make readers aware of Navajo attitude toward the dead, respect for burial sites. In the business world today, failure is apparently not an option. We need to change this attitude toward failure - and celebrate the idea that only by falling on our collective business faces do we learn enough to succeed down the road. I came on to the film with a very happy-go-lucky attitude which I think my character, Charlie, did when she went into the house. I expected it to be good, and then slowly things started to change for us all. I have the same attitude with work - I like to go to work, I like to work really hard I, like to give everything my all, I like to try things that are new, you know. There does not seem to be that collegiality I referred to, there seems to be much more of a them versus us attitude, rather than we all have a role to play in this process so let\\'s get on with it. I will not get very far with this attitude. Turkey wants a policy of engagement exactly like President Obama\\'s new approach. Policy of engagement, less confrontation, less tense attitude, especially in the region. I was entirely natural and in many ways I have the same attitude now. I don\\'t mourn the loss of my youth because I believe you should enjoy what you have while you have it. \\x0cOur new attitude is how can we put you in front of our customer. Unfortunately, the attitude of many towards the press, humanitarians included and especially government workers, is often one of suspicion, if not outright fear. After the first miscarriage, I tried to take the attitude that it was my body\\'s way of telling me that this pregnancy wasn\\'t meant to be. Nobody minded what you did in bed or what you said about God, a very civilized attitude in 1948. America won the Cold War by protecting our strategic resources from the threat of foreign control. We must bring the same attitude to our trade relationship with China. Our spiritual attitude is determined by our conception of our relation to infinite spirit. It\\'s really interesting with art- movies too, but art especially - to see how your attitude toward artists and works and your level of appreciation of them is always shifting and changing over the years. My opponents attitude is, \\'If it moves, tax it, if it keeps moving, regulate it and when it stops, subsidize it. The artist is not responsible to any one. His social role is asocial... his only responsibility consists in an attitude to the work he does. Somehow, the greater the public opposition to the health care bill, the more determined they seem to force it on us anyway. Their attitude shows Washington at its very worst - the presumption that they know best, and they\\'re going to get their way whether the American people like it or not. You know, who cares about seeing the girls when everybody wants to see the band. That\\'s what\\'s important, KISS is important. I think we look great, and the attitude is there, and I\\'m real happy with it. Athletic competition clearly defines the unique power of our attitude. I\\'m going to try to enjoy the All-Star break, hope my players reflect on what happened the first half of the season, come back with a different attitude, try to find our solution on how to win it. \\x0cI won\\'t say there aren\\'t any Harvard graduates who have never asserted a superior attitude. But they have done so to our great embarrassment and in no way represent the Harvard I know. Its attitude, which it has preached and practiced, is skepticism. Now, it finds, the public is applying that skepticism to the press. Each experience through which we pass operates ultimately for our good. This is a correct attitude to adopt and we must be able to see it in that light. When I drank, I had a very different attitude towards my playing. It was sloppier but I kind of liked it that way. It was like the alcohol was telling my mind what to do. I think we\\'re in good hands. There\\'s definitely much more momentum in bringing in good things to help support the show. Everyone\\'s got a good attitude about it and I think that makes all the difference. That attitude does not exist so much today, but in those days there was a very sharp distinction between basic physics and applied physics. Columbia did not deal with applied physics. My attitude towards drawing is not necessarily about drawing. It\\'s about making the best kind of image I can make, it\\'s about talking as clearly as I can. The attitude of the people proves that not only do we want to, but that we can succeed in pulling our country out of the difficult position it finds itself in. The banking system of our country will survive and grow. Patton was living in the Dark Ages. Soldiers were peasants to him. I didn\\'t like that attitude. Hence, within the space of two generations there has been a complete revolution in the attitude of the trades-unions toward the women working in their trades. Bader\\'s philosophy was my philosophy. His whole attitude to life was mine. Americans have always had an ambivalent attitude toward intelligence. When they feel threatened, they want a lot of it, and when they don\\'t, they regard the whole thing as somewhat immoral. \\x0cWe will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given to us without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes! That is the miracle of it. If you eat something and get fat, you should be responsible for it. I think that is the attitude of the great majority of Americans, that you should be responsible for what you eat. My deepest impulses are optimistic, an attitude that seems to me as spiritually necessary and proper as it is intellectually suspect. I also had a mistaken attitude towards certain comrades. I film quite a bit of footage, then edit. Changes before your eyes, things you can do and things you can\\'t. My attitude is always \\'let it keep rolling.\\' Global political conditions make a direct American intervention difficult, but President Reagan\\'s messianic and visceral attitude toward the Nicaraguan revolution could mean it will happen as an act of desperation. Muslims have a very bad attitude to homosexuality, they\\'re very intolerant. Mental attitude and concentration are the keys to pitching. My first feeling about the paper and the attitude is that it is absurd. A discipline I have observed is an attitude of love and reverence to people. The attitude of the actor is his interpretation of what he reads, and the written word is what creates the role in the actor\\'s mind, and I guess in reading the things that were given to me, I reacted as you guys saw me, you know. I can\\'t believe the pro- choicers attitude toward unborn children-to me it\\'s the ultimate liberal cause, to defend those without a voice. An attitude of philosophic doubt, of suspended judgment, is repugnant to the natural man. Belief is an independent joy to him. Even when I\\'m playing someone named Fat Amy, I\\'m all about confidence and attitude. Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it. To love beauty is to see light. \\x0cBeauty is only skin deep. If you go after someone just because she\\'s beautiful but don\\'t have anything to talk about, it\\'s going to get boring fast. You want to look beyond the surface and see if you can have fun or if you have anything in common with this person. A woman whose smile is open and whose expression is glad has a kind of beauty no matter what she wears. People are like stained - glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within. The pursuit of truth and beauty is a sphere of activity in which we are permitted to remain children all our lives. Of life\\'s two chief prizes, beauty and truth, I found the first in a loving heart and the second in a laborer\\'s hand. Love of beauty is taste. The creation of beauty is art. Life is full of beauty. Notice it. Notice the bumble bee, the small child, and the smiling faces. Smell the rain, and feel the wind. Live your life to the fullest potential, and fight for your dreams. A thing of beauty is a joy forever: its loveliness increases it will never pass into nothingness. Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror. A beauty is a woman you notice a charmer is one who notices you. The soul that sees beauty may sometimes walk alone. Flowers... are a proud assertion that a ray of beauty outvalues all the utilities of the world. She got her looks from her father. He\\'s a plastic surgeon. Beauty and folly are old companions. Rare is the union of beauty and purity. Personal beauty is a greater recommendation than any letter of reference. Beauty is unbearable, drives us to despair, offering us for a minute the glimpse of an eternity that we should like to stretch out over the whole of time. The world\\'s biggest power is the youth and beauty of a woman. Beauty awakens the soul to act. A witty woman is a treasure a witty beauty is a power. Think of all the beauty still left around you and be happy. \\x0cBeauty is a manifestation of secret natural laws, which otherwise would have been hidden from us forever. Beauty is all very well at first sight but who ever looks at it when it has been in the house three days? Beauty has a lot to do with character. There is no definition of beauty, but when you can see someone\\'s spirit coming through, something unexplainable, that\\'s beautiful to me. For me the greatest beauty always lies in the greatest clarity. Since love grows within you, so beauty grows. For love is the beauty of the soul. I define nothing. Not beauty, not patriotism. I take each thing as it is, without prior rules about what it should be. Beauty is worse than wine, it intoxicates both the holder and beholder. Beauty in things exists in the mind which contemplates them. I do not have much patience with a thing of beauty that must be explained to be understood. If it does need additional interpretation by someone other than the creator, then I question whether it has fulfilled its purpose. I don\\'t think of all the misery but of the beauty that still remains. Beauty is not caused. It is. Beauty is truth\\'s smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror. Beauty is everywhere a welcome guest. It is amazing how complete is the delusion that beauty is goodness. A mode of conduct, a standard of courage, discipline, fortitude and integrity can do a great deal to make a woman beautiful. Beauty, n: the power by which a woman charms a lover and terrifies a husband. Dear God! how beauty varies in nature and art. In a woman the flesh must be like marble in a statue the marble must be like flesh. Beauty doesn\\'t need ornaments. Softness can\\'t bear the weight of ornaments. Beauty is in the heart of the beholder. Let us live for the beauty of our own reality. \\x0cEvery year of my life I grow more convinced that it is wisest and best to fix our attention on the beautiful and the good, and dwell as little as possible on the evil and the false. Never lose an opportunity of seeing anything beautiful, for beauty is God\\'s handwriting. Beauty is the promise of happiness. We live in a wonderful world that is full of beauty, charm and adventure. There is no end to the adventures that we can have if only we seek them with our eyes open. Imagination disposes of everything it creates beauty, justice, and happiness, which are everything in this world. A women\\'s greatest asset is her beauty. Beauty is indeed a good gift of God but that the good may not think it a great good, God dispenses it even to the wicked. Beauty is power a smile is its sword. Beauty itself is but the sensible image of the Infinite. If you look closely at a tree you\\'ll notice it\\'s knots and dead branches, just like our bodies. What we learn is that beauty and imperfection go together wonderfully. Beauty is ever to the lonely mind a shadow fleeting she is never plain. She is a visitor who leaves behind the gift of grief, the souvenir of pain. Beauty is only temporary, but your mind lasts you a lifetime. Beauty is a fragile gift. Beauty saves. Beauty heals. Beauty motivates. Beauty unites. Beauty returns us to our origins, and here lies the ultimate act of saving, of healing, of overcoming dualism. In every man\\'s heart there is a secret nerve that answers to the vibrations of beauty. Love built on beauty, soon as beauty, dies. I don\\'t need plastic in my body to validate me as a woman. I gave my beauty and my youth to men. I am going to give my wisdom and experience to animals. The problem with beauty is that it\\'s like being born rich and getting poorer. In youth and beauty, wisdom is but rare! Heat cannot be separated from fire, or beauty from The Eternal. Having inner beauty is something you develop on your own, and I like to think I have that. \\x0cBeauty is less important than quality. There is a kind of beauty in imperfection. When virtue and modesty enlighten her charms, the lustre of a beautiful woman is brighter than the stars of heaven, and the influence of her power it is in vain to resist. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant. Handsome\\' means many things to many people. If people consider me handsome, I feel flattered - and have my parents to thank for it.

Beauty in art is often nothing but ugliness subdued. \\x0cWhat saddens me is the corruption of youth and beauty, and the loss of soul, which is only replaced by money. When I think of art I think of beauty. Beauty is the mystery of life. It is not in the eye it is in the mind. In our minds there is awareness of perfection. The very definition of \\'beauty\\' is outside. I always loved aesthetics. Not particularly fashion, but an idea of beauty.

Hollywood needs to recognise all shades of African American beauty. \\x0cEditing yourself is like an irksome coin toss. You\\'ve got to strip yourself of super ego and operate from the id.

Beauty is a radiance that originates from within and comes from inner security and strong character. I tried for a while to be an agricultural worker and was hopelessly bored. To me it was meaningless. I would stand around in heaps of manure and sings about the beauty of the work I wasn\\'t doing. I tried for a while to be an agricultural worker and was hopelessly bored.

It has fast pace and excitement, but it also has heart and soul. Beauty can come in strange forms. And I think of that again as I\\'ve written in several of my beauty books, a lot of health comes from the proper eating habits, which are something that - you know, I come from a generation that wasn\\'t - didn\\'t have a lot of food. Well I\\'ve written four beauty books as well. Bologna is the best city in Italy for food and has the least number of tourists. With its medieval beauty, it has it all. \\x0cI think we have become obsessed with beauty and personally I\\'m really saddened by the way women mutilate their faces today in search of that. Beauty, more than bitterness, makes the heart break. I thought to be feminine was to give in to straight culture, or the beauty standard, but in my heart I had a flair for fashion and style. They were passions I kept secret because I didn\\'t understand I could love clothes and hair and makeup and still like girls. Thanks to capitalism, the importance placed on beauty has never been so manipulated. We are the guinea pigs force-fed ads that tell us how pathetic we are: that we will never be loved, happy or valuable unless we have the body, the face, the hair, even the personality that will apparently be ours, if only we buy their products.

The beauty that addresses itself to the eyes is only the spell of the moment the eye of the body is not always that of the soul. The trick of this thing and the beauty of this thing is that it\\'s a cowboy movie first and then stuff happens. Even after stuff happens it doesn\\'t change - it hasn\\'t suddenly changed into another kind of movie. It\\'s still a cowboy movie. And that\\'s what\\'s incredible about it because nobody has done that before, that\\'s new territory. With guys I revere, like Marcus Garvey or Malcolm X, their look is less about style than purpose and the expression of beauty. It wasn\\'t just about being noticed, you know? \\x0cWho knows better than artists how much ugliness there is on the way to beauty, how many ghastly, mortifying missteps, how many days of granitic blockheadedness and dismaying ineptitude there is on the way to accomplishment, how partial all accomplishment is, how incomplete? Every man who has shown the world the way to beauty, to true culture, has been a rebel, a \\'universal\\' without patriotism, without home, who has found his people everywhere.  I discovered that the horse is life itself, a metaphor but also an example of life\\'s mystery and unpredictability, of life\\'s generosity and beauty, a worthy object of repeated and ever changing contemplation.

I love the game, it\\'s the greatest game on earth, that\\'s why I can\\'t understand all of this talk about trying to make the game better.

I am an unconventional beauty. I grew up in a high school where if you didn\\'t have a nose job and money and if you weren\\'t thin, you weren\\'t cool, popular, beautiful. I was always told that I wasn\\'t pretty enough to be on television. Our situation today shows that beauty demands for itself at least as much courage and decision as do truth and goodness, and she will not allow herself to be separated and banned from her two sisters without taking them along with herself in an act of mysterious vengeance.  For me art and chess are closely related, both are forms in which the self finds beauty and expression. But I think it is a serious issue to wonder about the other platonic absolutes of say beauty and morality. I was never an ambitious girl, or even a self-confident one. I never went in for beauty pageants or wore a stitch of make-up until I went to Los Angeles. What delights us in visible beauty is the invisible. There is a role and function for beauty in our time. I like the beauty of Faulkner\\'s poetry. But I don\\'t like his themes, not at all. You get more churches burned down in the United States in the last two years than in the last hundred, because of the lack of understanding of culture and diversity and the beauty of it. You, too, women, cast away all the cowards from your embraces they will give you only cowards for children, and you who are the daughters of the land of beauty must bear children who are noble and brave. All my writing is about the recognition that there is no single reality. But the beauty of it is that you nevertheless go on, walking towards utopia, which may not exist, on a bridge which might end before you reach the other side. I thought it might be a good move to get into a beauty contest so I tried for Miss Pennsylvania and won. I think that helped me get noticed, at least by the people of Pennsylvania. \\x0cThe beauty of a strong, lasting commitment is often best understood by men incapable of it. What I like about cities is that everything is king size, the beauty and the ugliness. Beauty is a precious trace that eternity causes to appear to us and that it takes away from us. A manifestation of eternity, and a sign of death as well. A beautiful bouquet or a long- lasting flowering plant is a traditional gift for women, but I have recommended that both men and women keep fresh flowers in the home for their beauty, fragrance, and the lift they give our spirits. Avon invented the concept of direct marketing and direct selling beauty. And that\\'s still very valid to us. We\\'ll have a firm that will be around for another 114 years as strongly as it was the first 114.  A representative is free delivery she\\'s a personal beauty consultant. Some people want that high touch. The game in beauty is changing so much, if your product isn\\'t high tech or can\\'t make a unique performance claim - plump your lips, reduce your lines, look glossy, and stay on for 24 hours - you can\\'t go to market today. I\\'m not just talking about a $20 lipstick, but a $5 lipstick! There are two ways to worry words. One is hoping for the greatest possible beauty in what is created. The other is to tell the truth. I think the 1970s will always be the decade for me. Obviously, I grew up in that era, but the beauty standard was touchable, kissable. Faith goes out through the window when beauty comes in at the door. Grandeur and beauty are so very opposite, that you often diminish the one as you increase the other. Variety is most akin to the latter, simplicity to the former. Power and beauty come from a very deep place. Beauty can\\'t amuse you, but brainwork - reading, writing, thinking - can. Wigs have always been a part of my life and have become a staple accessory in my closet. I can remember being a little girl and hearing all the commotion in my house from my mom, aunts and grandmother when picking out their wigs for the day. It was such a good time for them and part of their everyday beauty routine. \\x0cI think we should all be tolerant of each other and embrace each others\\' strengths and differences and uniqueness and beauty. I have girls who are concerned about how they look compared to models or what have you. It\\'s my responsibility to teach them that beauty is more than superficial. The beauty about the D-list is that people who are on it probably don\\'t know they are. I find, in being black, a thing of beauty: a joy a strength a secret cup of gladness. I\\'m only wanted by directors for the image I give off, and it makes me angry. I always wanted to be an actor and not a beauty pageant winner. My idea of beauty is somebody that doesn\\'t have to try too much, someone who is effortless and fresh. The English Bible - a book which, if everything else in our language should perish, would alone suffice to show the whole extent of its beauty and power. A supermodel needed to be able to be on \\'Sports Illustrated,\\' to be able to walk runways, to be able to do beauty ads, to be on covers. And the girls now can no longer be on covers and be in the ads because your actresses have taken over all the jobs. I don\\'t know what happened, but we want our jobs back. Familiarity is a magician that is cruel to beauty but kind to ugliness. There\\'s a beauty in being part of a band, when there\\'s equality and trust. I learned the truth at seventeen, That love was meant for beauty queens, And high school girls with clear skinned smiles, Who married young and then retired. It\\'s nice to just embrace the natural beauty within you. A few years ago I lost 30 pounds, and people still wanted to criticize. And honestly, I\\'m happy with myself if I\\'m a little heavier. I realized: \\'Why am I trying to conform to someone else\\'s idea of beauty?\\' I think I\\'m beautiful either way. \\x0cWe have magnificent brains, but we use a great deal of our brilliance to keep ourselves stuck and ignorant, to keep ourselves from not shining. We are so afraid of our beauty and radiance and brilliance because it scared the adults around us when we were children. If I weren\\'t performing, I\\'d be a beauty editor or a therapist. I love creativity, but I also love to help others. My mother was a hairstylist, and they listen to everyone\\'s problems - like a beauty therapist! You don\\'t know what the Chinese expect in the way of beauty. The presentation is just a farce. You come into a room filled with 50 people and they don\\'t talk to you. There\\'s very little interaction. Los Angeles is like a beauty parlor at the end of the universe. A special kind of beauty exists which is born in language, of language, and for language. Beauty must appeal to the senses, must provide us with immediate enjoyment, must impress us or insinuate itself into us without any effort on our part. The ideal has many names, and beauty is but one of them. As an inspiration to the author, I do not think the cat can be over-estimated. He suggests so much grace, power, beauty, motion, mysticism. I do not wonder that many writers love cats I am only surprised that all do not. I\\'m proud that today, at 43 years old, I\\'ve come to value the aging process and focus on inner rather than outer beauty. There\\'s no such thing is aging, but maturing and knowledge. It\\'s beautiful, I call that beauty. Not longer loved or fostered by religion, beauty is lifted from its face as a mask, and its absence exposes features on that face which threaten to become incomprehensible to man. We no longer dare to believe in beauty and we make of it a mere appearance in order the more easily to dispose of it. I believe every chess player senses beauty, when he succeeds in creating situations, which contradict the expectations and the rules, and he succeeds in mastering this situation. \\x0cThe development of beauty in chess never depends on you alone. No matter how much imagination and creativity you invest, you still do not create beauty. Your opponent must react at the same highest level. I really wanted there to be something in my life that I enjoy just for the beauty of it. The New York City Ballet is obviously speaking to a whole new generation and bringing it the same wonder and beauty that it brought previous generations. Many a genius has been slow of growth. Oaks that flourish for a thousand years do not spring up into beauty like a reed. Every performance is different. That\\'s the beauty of it. My daily beauty regimen is definitely always in the mornings, and at night, always washing my face with a basic cleanser. I also use a moisturizer with SPF to follow up. We all have to find beauty within us, as opposed to just our exterior. People tend not to use this word beauty because it\\'s not intellectual - but there has to be an overlap between beauty and intellect. One night I\\'ll be in Los Angeles and it\\'ll be a Latin crowd, and then another night I\\'ll go to Fresno and it\\'ll be an all-black crowd. To me, that\\'s the beauty of the music. That\\'s the beauty of being a comedian - it\\'s the one job you\\'re allowed to do that. We\\'re lucky. We\\'re really lucky. The difference between Marilyn Monroe and the early Pamela Anderson is not that great. What\\'s amazing is that the taste of American men and international tastes in terms of beauty have essentially stayed the same. Styles change, but our view of beauty stays the same. I felt Joyce was an influence on my fiction, but in a very general way, as a kind of inspiration and a model for the beauty of language. The beauty of having a producer is that you have someone who says, You\\'re finished. Comics are so full of amazing work. And I can\\'t look at a drawing of a woman without thinking of, for instance, Wallace Wood and his amazing way of capturing beauty. \\x0cI cannot go to Montreal without going to Beauty\\'s, my favorite place for breakfast, where I have the Mish-Mash omelet with hot dogs, salami, eggs, green peppers, and onions, and the best banana bread in the world. It\\'s legendary! Beauty set up distance between other people and me. It warped their behavior. People see you as an object, not as a person, and they project a set of expectations onto you. People who don\\'t have it think beauty is a blessing, but actually it sets you apart. A child does not notice the greatness and the beauty of nature and the splendor of God in his works. Once you go inside and weed through the muck, you will find the real beauty, the truth about yourself. I used to wear a lot of red lipstick, and when I got a pimple, I\\'d cover it up with eyeliner to turn it into a beauty mark. I\\'m flatchested, I\\'m short, I\\'m brunette, I have droopy eyes, and so people have a hard time casting me as a \\'beauty.\\' Doors open because you\\'re beautiful, but I wouldn\\'t cultivate beauty to the exclusion of brains. Beauty lasts five minutes. Maybe longer if you have a good plastic surgeon. Beauty is produced by the pleasing appearance and good taste of the whole, and by the dimensions of all the parts being duly proportioned to each other. That\\'s the beauty of music. You can take a theme from a Bach sacred chorale and improvise. It doesn\\'t make any difference where the theme comes from the treatment of it can be jazz. Asian people have a unique way about them and a different sense of beauty. It\\'s exotic to me. I like they way Asians project their feelings. There\\'s a hardness to the culture, but at the same time there\\'s a delicateness. This is the artist, then, life\\'s hungry man, the glutton of eternity, beauty\\'s miser, glory\\'s slave. Many attempts have been made by writers on art and poetry to define beauty in the abstract, to express it in the most general terms, to find some universal formula for it. \\x0cSuch discussions help us very little to enjoy what has been well done in art or poetry, to discriminate between what is more and what is less excellent in them, or to use words like beauty, excellence, art, poetry, with a more precise meaning than they would otherwise have. What is important, then, is not that the critic should possess a correct abstract definition of beauty for the intellect, but a certain kind of temperament, the power of being deeply moved by the presence of beautiful objects. One of the most beautiful passages of Rousseau is that in the sixth book of Confessions, where he describes the awakening in him of the literary sense. Of such wisdom, the poetic passion, the desire of beauty, the love of art for its own sake, has most. I mean the beauty of being a writer is it\\'s not like being a swimmer. When they were talking about our Olympic swimmers and they\\'d say, \\'Oh she\\'s so old,\\' and she\\'s all of 25 or something. So the beauty for a writer is that you can keep doing it right into your dotage, and I hope to be able to keep doing it as long as I can get away with it, yeah. I had a lot of resentment for a while toward Kim Novak. But I don\\'t mind her anymore. She\\'s okay. We\\'ve become friends. I even asked her before this trip for some beauty tips. But the beauty of Einstein\\'s equations, for example, is just as real to anyone who\\'s experienced it as the beauty of music. We\\'ve learned in the 20th century that the equations that work have inner harmony. I think beauty comes from within. If you\\'re happy and look at life in the best way you can, even when there are problems, it can make you beautiful on the outside. I think there\\'s a great beauty to having problems. That\\'s one of the ways we learn. Truth is a thing immortal and perpetual, and it gives to us a beauty that fades not away in time. My quick beauty tip is always have a tinted gloss of some kind to give you some color even if you have no makeup on. I think beauty comes from within, and society paints a ridiculous picture. \\x0cMy daily beauty regimen consists of washing my face before bed and putting on moisturizer. My unusual beauty tip is that I often use Vaseline to take my make up off. It works great and is good for sensitive skin. I envy the sensibility in Europe, appreciating beauty in women as they age. I\\'m going to go that way. I might dye my gray hair for a bit, but beyond that the buck stops. I\\'m not having any work done. You may keep your beauty and your health, unless you destroy them yourself, or discourage them to stay with you, by using them ill. So every creative act strives to attain an absolute status it longs to create a world of beauty to triumph over chaos and convert it to order. Oh who can tell the range of joy or set the bounds of beauty? Music, as many people have said, is the universal language. Of course points are made which make you think about things, but ultimately it makes you feel. And that\\'s why people remember more songs that have meant something during their life than films. They start to define periods in your life, and that\\'s kind of the beauty of it. No single man can be taken as a model for a perfect figure, for no man lives on earth who is endowed with the whole of beauty. Music, art, theater. I\\'m just a big fan of beauty. There\\'s a sadness to the human condition that I think music is good for. It gives a counterpoint to the visual beauty, and adds depth to pictures that they wouldn\\'t have if the music wasn\\'t there. The idea that happiness could have a share in beauty would be too much of a good thing. I remember reminding myself that beauty is an opinion, not a fact. And it has always made me feel better. The thought came to me that all one loves in art becomes beautiful. Beauty is nothing but the expression of the fact that something is being loved. Only thus could she be defined. I have a real passion for many aspects of home lifestyle and beauty. \\x0cThe more people explore the world, the more they realize in every country there\\'s a different aesthetic. Beauty really is in the eye of the beholder. There will always be a desire for something new, fresh and innovative, as well as a yearning and respect for timeless elegance and beauty. The difference between utility and utility plus beauty is the difference between telephone wires and the spider web. I felt I had to share Idaho with my friend from New York because he\\'d shared New York with me, so I was going to share the beauty of nature with a man who went to museums and clubs late at night. But there was nothing to do where I lived at night. Beauty comes from the inside. The South is very beautiful but its beauty makes one sad because the lives that people live here, and have lived here, are so ugly. For me, a page of good prose is where one hears the rain and the noise of battle. It has the power to give grief or universality that lends it a youthful beauty. After \\'Freaks and Geeks,\\' I dealt with several producers who wanted to cover up all my beauty marks, every single mole on my body. They tried to cover them on my first two episodes of \\'Dawson\\'s Creek,\\' and it just looked ridiculous, so I had to put my foot down. But it\\'s not something I\\'m insecure about. I recognize in thieves, traitors and murderers, in the ruthless and the cunning, a deep beauty - a sunken beauty. As a mom, I don\\'t have much time for beauty. The pattern of a newspaperman\\'s life is like the plot of \\'Black Beauty.\\' Sometimes he finds a kind master who gives him a dry stall and an occasional bran mash in the form of a Christmas bonus, sometimes he falls into the hands of a mean owner who drives him in spite of spavins and expects him to live on potato peelings. The beauty of doing film is that you construct whatever you do block by block and you can build something that will stay. As a girl, you\\'re supposed to love Sleeping Beauty. I mean, who wants to love Sleeping Beauty when you can be Aladdin? \\x0cI believe it\\'s time that women truly owned their superpowers and used their beauty and strength to change the world around them. Some songs you get. Some songs you may not. And I think that\\'s the beauty of art: to question and to ask, to understand the deeper meaning after two or three or four listenings. I know that I\\'ve got big ears and a big forehead and that my hair sticks up. But I\\'m happy with myself. I\\'m not necessarily trying to win a beauty pageant here. My theory of characterization is basically this: Put some dirt on a hero, and put some sunshine on the villain, one brush stroke of beauty on the villain. I think the beauty looks I most regret are those I was persuaded into. Physical beauty isn\\'t so impressive to me. I love glamour and artificial beauty. I love the idea of artifice and dressing up and makeup and hair. My beauty icons are women whose images are self- created. I really believe that beauty comes from health - sensible eating and exercise. I do not see any beauty in self-restraint. Beauty and the Beast seemed like it all was really brown. The whole thing was just so brown and orange and yellow, like Burger King or something. I don\\'t think I would have liked Beauty and the Beast at any age. All things are perceived in the light of charity, and hence under the aspect of beauty for beauty is simply reality seen with the eyes of love. Solitude has its own very strange beauty to it. Blanche talks about aging, and why should she be considered poor, because physical beauty is transitory and fading and she has such richness of the soul. I think that speech is so beautiful, and so telling and so true. The real message of the Dance opens up the vistas of life to all who have the urge to express beauty with no other instrument than their own bodies, with no apparatus and no dependence on anything other than space. I have a desire to create more film, more beauty, more art, more love, but I don\\'t feel desperate. It\\'s not about creating or building a career. \\x0cBoxing is my real passion. I can go to ballet, theatre, movies, or other sporting events... and nothing is like the fights to me. I\\'m excited by the visual beauty of it. A boxer can look so spectacular by doing a good job. I needed to be in the bush. There I find solitude and beauty and purity and focus. That\\'s where my heart lies. It\\'s just poetry, beauty and love. How hard can that be to act? Never once does \\'Snow White\\' herself look in the mirror so she isn\\'t aware of her beauty or what apparently that does to people. It\\'s really just the queen and the prince that talk about it. It is, finally, a word is untimely in three different senses, and bearing it as one\\'s treasure will not win one anyone\\'s favours one rather risks finding oneself outside everyone\\'s camp... Beauty is the word that shall be our first. I didn\\'t grow up identifying with beauty. I grew up thinking I could be smart and funny - those are the things I got feedback on. Even if you play perfectly, a fault of your opponent\\'s can destroy the entire beauty of the game. When I speak of the beauty of a game of chess, then naturally this is subjective. Beauty can be found in a very technical, mathematical game for example. That is the beauty of clarity. My mama told me in college, \\'I love you, and you\\'re God\\'s child, but natural beauty will only take you so far.\\' I have learned that acting is not about beauty. Proportions are what makes the old Greek temples classic in their beauty. They are like huge blocks, from which the air has been literally hewn out between the columns. I am thrilled to be able to bring my vision of beauty to others who may be inspired by it. I\\'m still figuring out why people would want to look at me. Maybe it\\'s generic beauty, but it\\'s weird to be valued for something I was born with. It\\'s hard to say what drives a three year-old, but I think I had a sense that nature was my solace, and nature was a place in which there was beauty, in which there was order. It\\'s not fair the emphasis put on beauty, or on sexuality. \\x0cEvery article on these islands has an almost personal character, which gives this simple life, where all art is unknown, something of the artistic beauty of medieval life. But when I was twelve years old I caught my first strong glimpse of one of the fundamental forces of existence, whose votary I was destined to be for life - namely, Beauty. Nothing can atone for the lack of modesty without which beauty is ungraceful and wit detestable. So, we just kind of created our own thing and that\\'s part of the beauty of Athens: is that it\\'s so off the map and there\\'s no way you could ever be the East Village or an L.A. scene or a San Francisco scene, that it just became its own thing. The beauty of voice-over work is that maybe you come in and record once every two weeks for a couple of hours and do a couple episodes a session. It\\'s awesome! You spend an afternoon playing in the booth, and there you have it. It doesn\\'t interfere with much. My mom was an aesthetician and she went to beauty school back in the \\'60s. I just remember watching her do her makeup all the time. She always had her nails done, makeup on - her face was ready to go when she went out. I loved it. I grew up in a family where we weren\\'t allowed to talk about beauty or to put any emphasis on physical appearance. This whole beauty thing is something I\\'ve never comprehended. I thought of Paris as a beauty spot on the face of the earth, and of London as a big freckle. We tell them that we believe it will be beautiful because that is our specialty, we only create joy and beauty. We have never done a sad work. Through the drawings, we hope a majority will be able to visualize it. And for me, the real world involves everything: risk, danger, beauty, energy, all we meet with in the real world. Throughout the centuries, man has considered himself beautiful. I rather suppose that man only believes in his own beauty out of pride that he is not really beautiful and he suspects this himself for why does he look on the face of his fellow-man with such scorn? \\x0cPoetry a criticism of life under the conditions fixed for such a criticism by the laws of poetic truth and poetic beauty. The concept of active cooperation has taken the place of opposition to the new form of government and of dreamy resignation entranced with the beauty of times past. We say we want to create beauty, identity, quality, singularity. And yet, maybe in truth these cities that we have are desired. Maybe their very characterlessness provides the best context for living. He was afflicted by the thought that where Beauty was, nothing ever ran quite straight, which no doubt, was why so many people looked on it as immoral. Americans worship creativity the way they worship physical beauty - as a way of enjoying elitism without guilt: God did it. I was amazed and upset by the looks I got just walking around the studio... It illuminates the ugliness and the beauty that exists within each of us, and that\\'s what this story represents to me. Beauty is only skin deep, and the world is full of thin skinned people. That brings me to Dennis Ritchie. Our collaboration has been a thing of beauty. When you put the interest of a kid on money instead of heart then you\\'re destroying the beauty of our lives and our thought process, which should be about how much responsibilities you carry as an athlete and a citizen. One of my favorite beauty products is Vincent Longo Water Canvas creamy blush. I have it in every color and I\\'ve been using it for 5 years and that\\'s all I put on when I leave the house. It looks so natural I just put a little bit on my cheeks to give them some color. Everyday life is like programming, I guess. If you love something you can put beauty into it. I\\'m always suspicious of really beautiful women telling us we shouldn\\'t be worried about beauty. The beauty of a main title is that you establish your main theme and maybe a bit of your secondary theme. You plant the seed that you\\'re going to go water later in the score. And so, having that removed just made it so much more difficult. Beauty seen is never lost, God\\'s colors all are fast. \\x0cIf the world could remain within a frame like a painting on the wall, I think we\\'d see the beauty then and stand staring in awe. Unless action is taken soon - unless we can display the same vision of that earlier period - we will lose the treasure of California\\'s open space and environmental beauty. Remember always that the composer\\'s pen is still mightier than the bow of the violinist in you lie all the possibilities of the creation of beauty. Grand opera is the most powerful of stage appeals and that almost entirely through the beauty of music. I guess if you take yourself seriously as an artist there starts either the problem or the beauty of doing good artwork. I just wanted to see every single musical I could. The very first one I saw was \\'Beauty and the Beast,\\' the only one I could get tickets for, and then \\'Les Miserables\\' and then \\'Chicago.\\' My duty is to try to reach beauty. Cinema is emotion. When you laugh you cry. The expression of beauty is in direct ratio to the power of conception the artist has acquired. It is curious how, from time immemorial, man seems to have associated the idea of evil with beauty, shrunk from it with a sort of ghostly fear, while, at the same time drawn to it by force of its hypnotic attraction. The beauty we love is very silent. It smiles softly to itself, but never speaks. We also maintain - again with perfect truth - that mystery is more than half of beauty, the element of strangeness that stirs the senses through the imagination. A woman\\'s beauty is one of her great missions. I\\'ve developed into quite a swan. I\\'m one of those people that will probably look better and better as I get older until I drop dead of beauty. I appreciate simplicity, true beauty that lasts over time, and a little wit and eclecticism that make life more fun. Beauty has been democratised. No longer the preserve of movie stars and models but available to all. But while the invitation to beauty is welcomed, it has become not so much an option as an imperative. \\x0cBeauty is the oracle that speaks to us all. The real beauty of it - key to my life was playing key chords on a banjo. For somebody else it may be a golf club that mom and dad put in their hands or a baseball or ballet lessons. Real gift to give to me and put it in writing. In the 19th century, you had bourgeois art without politics - an almost frozen idea of what beauty is. My beauty icon is Angelina Jolie. It\\'s not like I\\'m sitting at home coming up with some secret beauty plan. One of the basic things about a string is that it can vibrate in many different shapes or forms, which gives music its beauty. Every one who has a heart, however ignorant of architecture he may be, feels the transcendent beauty and poetry of the mediaeval churches. Personal beauty is a greater recommendation than any letter of reference. We live in a state with a wonderful climate and plenty of natural beauty, from the shores of Cumberland Island to the Chattahoochee River to the Blue Ridge Mountains. I hope that in some way that I can be some sort of beacon of hope, especially because I am not the typical Hollywood beauty. I was always interested in fashion and beauty. I was fifteen when I was scouted in a flea market. Two years later, I arrived in New York. I was in awe because it was like another planet. Latin life is rich with warmth, family values and history. I want to bring that beauty into American homes. Being nerdy just means being passionate about something, including everyone - the coolest people on Earth are passionate and therefore nerdy about something whatever it is, whether it\\'s sports, or gaming, or technology, or fashion, or beauty, or food, or whatever. Listening to my regular favourites - Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and so on - I always feel, quite misguidedly, that nothing can be too bad if such beauty and brilliance exists in the world. The reason that the all- American boy prefers beauty to brains is that he can see better than he can think. \\x0cI love my beauty. It\\'s not my fault. A sculptor wields The chisel, and the stricken marble grows To beauty. My mother is a beauty. Beauty is the result of having been through an experience all the way through to the end - therefore it has a poignancy. Beauty that is singular always comes from following an experience to the point where you can go no further. No eyes that have seen beauty ever lose their sight. The world is a crazy, beautiful, ugly complicated place, and it keeps moving on from crisis to strangeness to beauty to weirdness to tragedy. The caravan keeps moving on, and the job of the longform writer or filmmaker or radio broadcaster is to stop - is to pause - and when the caravan goes away, that\\'s when this stuff comes. Sometimes I think I might not have written \\'The Age of Miracles\\' if I hadn\\'t grown up in California, if I hadn\\'t been exposed to its very particular blend of beauty and disaster, of danger and denial.

We say yes, merely because we are driven into a corner and must say something. There is only one real sin and that is to persuade oneself that the second best is anything but second best. Nobody who ever gave his best regretted it. Since we live in this world, we have to do our best for this world. Enthusiasm is the best protection in any situation. Wholeheartedness is contagious. Give yourself, if you wish to get others. First gain the victory and then make the best use of it you can. The best way to navigate through life is to give up all of our controls. When you do not know what you are doing and what you are doing is the best - that is inspiration. The creed of a true saint is to make the best of life, and to make the most of it. Just do what you do best. The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart. I believe in pink. I believe that laughing is the best calorie burner. I believe in kissing, kissing a lot. I believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong. I believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls. I believe that tomorrow is another day and I believe in miracles. Health is the greatest gift, contentment the greatest wealth, faithfulness the best relationship. We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love. There is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies. \\x0cWrite it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year. God always gives His best to those who leave the choice with him. Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later. A wise man is superior to any insults which can be put upon him, and the best reply to unseemly behavior is patience and moderation. My formula for living is quite simple. I get up in the morning and I go to bed at night. In between, I occupy myself as best I can. The key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter. The best thing about the future is that it comes one day at a time. Sleep is the best meditation. The things I want to know are in books my best friend is the man who\\'ll get me a book I ain\\'t read. You can\\'t stop loving or wanting to love because when its right it\\'s the best thing in the world. When you\\'re in a relationship and its good, even if nothing else in your life is right, you feel like your whole world is complete. The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil in its worst state, an intolerable one. Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret. A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves. I believe God is managing affairs and that He doesn\\'t need any advice from me. With God in charge, I believe everything will work out for the best in the end. So what is there to worry about. My mama always used to tell me: \\'If you can\\'t find somethin\\' to live for, you best find somethin\\' to die for.\\' The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand. \\x0cMy dream is of a place and a time where America will once again be seen as the last best hope of earth. Common looking people are the best in the world: that is the reason the Lord makes so many of them. An investment in knowledge pays the best interest. The age of a woman doesn\\'t mean a thing. The best tunes are played on the oldest fiddles. I am prepared for the worst, but hope for the best. Our prayers should be for blessings in general, for God knows best what is good for us. The best proof of love is trust. All the adversity I\\'ve had in my life, all my troubles and obstacles, have strengthened me... You may not realize it when it happens, but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you. For a people who are free, and who mean to remain so, a well-organized and armed militia is their best security. One\\'s philosophy is not best expressed in words it is expressed in the choices one makes... and the choices we make are ultimately our responsibility. The best way to destroy an enemy is to make him a friend. The best years of your life are the ones in which you decide your problems are your own. You do not blame them on your mother, the ecology, or the president. You realize that you control your own destiny. My best friend is the man who in wishing me well wishes it for my sake. I never had a policy I have just tried to do my very best each and every day. If it\\'s your job to eat a frog, it\\'s best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it\\'s your job to eat two frogs, it\\'s best to eat the biggest one first. Honesty is the best policy. I want it said of me by those who knew me best, that I always plucked a thistle and planted a flower where I thought a flower would grow. Outside of a dog, a book is a man\\'s best friend. Inside of a dog it\\'s too dark to read. In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free - honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth. \\x0cThe best way to get a bad law repealed is to enforce it strictly. The best way to resolve any problem in the human world is for all sides to sit down and talk. When you have got an elephant by the hind legs and he is trying to run away, it\\'s best to let him run. We have the best government that money can buy. The time comes upon every public man when it is best for him to keep his lips closed. It is no use saying, \\'We are doing our best.\\' You have got to succeed in doing what is necessary. I am easily satisfied with the very best. The trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruit. Honesty is the best policy - when there is money in it. The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God. Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be. It is not best that we should all think alike it is a difference of opinion that makes horse races. If you die you\\'re completely happy and your soul somewhere lives on. I\\'m not afraid of dying. Total peace after death, becoming someone else is the best hope I\\'ve got. The best way out is always through. Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.  Prosperity is the best protector of principle. He who knows best knows how little he knows. The short words are best, and the old words are the best of all. Broadly speaking, the short words are the best, and the old words best of all. Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations. In war as in life, it is often necessary when some cherished scheme has failed, to take up the best alternative open, and if so, it is folly not to work for it with all your might. Short words are best and the old words when short are best of all. \\x0cEducation is the best friend. An educated person is respected everywhere. Education beats the beauty and the youth. Walking is the best possible exercise. Habituate yourself to walk very fast. Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge. It brings out all that is best it removes all that is base. All men are afraid in battle. The coward is the one who lets his fear overcome his sense of duty. Duty is the essence of manhood. If I\\'m honest I have to tell you I still read fairy-tales and I like them best of all. No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don\\'t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life\\'s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far the best ending for one. When we do the best that we can, we never know what miracle is wrought in our life, or in the life of another. The best smell in the world is that man that you love. The best minds are not in government. If any were, business would steal them away. To wear your heart on your sleeve isn\\'t a very good plan you should wear it inside, where it functions best. But men are men the best sometimes forget.  Surround yourself with the best people you can find, delegate authority, and don\\'t interfere as long as the policy you\\'ve decided upon is being carried out. My best friend is the one who brings out the best in me. If you have a positive attitude and constantly strive to give your best effort, eventually you will overcome your immediate problems and find you are ready for greater challenges. Infinite striving to be the best is man\\'s duty it is its own reward. Everything else is in God\\'s hands. My experience has been that work is almost the best way to pull oneself out of the depths. \\x0cI can not believe that war is the best solution. No one won the last war, and no one will win the next war. Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self- satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming. Tis best to weigh the enemy more mighty than he seems.;William Shakespeare;best 6245;If you can\\'t get rid of the skeleton in your closet, you\\'d best teach it to dance.;George Bernard Shaw;best 6246;Perhaps nature is our best assurance of immortality.;Eleanor Roosevelt;best 6247;Perhaps I know best why it is man alone who laughs he alone suffers so deeply that he had to invent laughter.;Friedrich Nietzsche;best 6248;When the best leader\\'s work is done the people say, \\'We did it ourselves. The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other begins? Why don\\'t you start believing that no matter what you have or haven\\'t done, that your best days are still out in front of you. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes. Personally, I just think rap music is the best thing out there, period. If you look at my deck in my car radio, you\\'re always going to find a hip-hop tape that\\'s all I buy, that\\'s all I live, that\\'s all I listen to, that\\'s all I love. The best weapon against an enemy is another enemy. You are capable of more than you know. Choose a goal that seems right for you and strive to be the best, however hard the path. Aim high. Behave honorably. Prepare to be alone at times, and to endure failure. Persist! The world needs all you can give. We have the power to make this the best generation of mankind in the history of the world or to make it the last. If liberty and equality, as is thought by some, are chiefly to be found in democracy, they will be best attained when all persons alike share in government to the utmost. \\x0cWhat we have found in this country, and maybe we\\'re more aware of it now, is one problem that we\\'ve had, even in the best of times, and that is the people who are sleeping on the grates, the homeless, you might say, by choice. An archaeologist is the best husband a woman can have. The older she gets the more interested he is in her. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best but what he has said or done otherwise shall give him no peace. Those who govern, having much business on their hands, do not generally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new projects. The best public measures are therefore seldom adopted from previous wisdom, but forced by the occasion. Hunger is the best pickle. The ideal man bears the accidents of life with dignity and grace, making the best of circumstances. It might be said now that I have the best of both worlds. A Harvard education and a Yale degree. A blessed thing it is for any man or woman to have a friend, one human soul whom we can trust utterly, who knows the best and worst of us, and who loves us in spite of all our faults. A good character is the best tombstone. Those who loved you and were helped by you will remember you when forget-me-nots have withered. Carve your name on hearts, not on marble. Fatigue is the best pillow. That government is best which governs least. Look at the sky. We are not alone. The whole universe is friendly to us and conspires only to give the best to those who dream and work. To give anything less than your best, is to sacrifice the gift. Thank you\\' is the best prayer that anyone could say. I say that one a lot. Thank you expresses extreme gratitude, humility, understanding.;Alice Walker;best 6271;Success comes from knowing that you did your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.;John Wooden;best 6272;The fox has many tricks. The hedgehog has but one.

All he has to do is get up every morning and say, \\'How is the president? Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art. Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art. I am just absolutely convinced that the best formula for giving us peace and preserving the American way of life is freedom, limited government, and minding our own business overseas. You are a product of your environment. So choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective. Analyze your life in terms of its environment. Are the things around you helping you toward success - or are they holding you back? Experience taught me a few things. One is to listen to your gut, no matter how good something sounds on paper. The second is that you\\'re generally better off sticking with what you know. And the third is that sometimes your best investments are the ones you don\\'t make. It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. I always believe that to be the best, you have to smell like the best, dress like the best, act like the best. When you throw your trash in the garbage can, it has to be better than anybody else who ever threw trash in the garbage can. I think it\\'s brought the world a lot closer together, and will continue to do that. There are downsides to everything there are unintended consequences to everything. The most corrosive piece of technology that I\\'ve ever seen is called television - but then, again, television, at its best, is magnificent. Do the best you can, and don\\'t take life too serious. Remember, always give your best. Never get discouraged. Never be petty. Always remember, others may hate you. But those who hate you don\\'t win unless you hate them. And then you destroy yourself. The pursuit, even of the best things, ought to be calm and tranquil. You may not realize it when it happens, but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you. \\x0cLife is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing what\\'s going to happen next. The worst thing that happens to you may be the best thing for you if you don\\'t let it get the best of you. Don\\'t be afraid to give your best to what seemingly are small jobs. Every time you conquer one it makes you that much stronger. If you do the little jobs well, the big ones will tend to take care of themselves. The best way to hold a man is in your arms. Society in every state is a blessing, but government, even in its best stage, is but a necessary evil in its worst state an intolerable one. It is difficult to make our material condition better by the best law, but it is easy enough to ruin it by bad laws. Our goal is to make the best devices in the world, not to be the biggest. If you\\'re doing your best, you won\\'t have any time to worry about failure. Civilization had too many rules for me, so I did my best to rewrite them. A failure is not always a mistake, it may simply be the best one can do under the circumstances. The real mistake is to stop trying. To help yourself, you must be yourself. Be the best that you can be. When you make a mistake, learn from it, pick yourself up and move on. We think the Mac will sell zillions, but we didn\\'t build the Mac for anybody else. We built it for ourselves. We were the group of people who were going to judge whether it was great or not. We weren\\'t going to go out and do market research. We just wanted to build the best thing we could build. If you believe in what you are doing, then let nothing hold you up in your work. Much of the best work of the world has been done against seeming impossibilities. The thing is to get the work done. I know my country has not perfected itself. At times, we\\'ve struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people. We\\'ve made our share of mistakes, and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions. \\x0cSo let\\'s not use a stylus. We\\'re going to use the best pointing device in the world. We\\'re going to use a pointing device that we\\'re all born with - born with ten of them. We\\'re going to use our fingers. We\\'re going to touch this with our fingers. And we have invented a new technology called multi-touch, which is phenomenal. It works like magic. We hire people who want to make the best things in the world. Dad needs to show an incredible amount of respect and humor and friendship toward his mate so the kids understand their parents are sexy, they\\'re fun, they do things together, they\\'re best friends. Kids learn by example. If I respect Mom, they\\'re going to respect Mom. Don\\'t lower your expectations to meet your performance. Raise your level of performance to meet your expectations. Expect the best of yourself, and then do what is necessary to make it a reality. A national political campaign is better than the best circus ever heard of, with a mass baptism and a couple of hangings thrown in. The best liar is he who makes the smallest amount of lying go the longest way. Doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the next moment. We are all travelers in the wilderness of this world, and the best we can find in our travels is an honest friend. My philosophy is that not only are you responsible for your life, but doing the best at this moment puts you I the best place for the next moment. An educated person is one who has learned that information almost always turns out to be at best incomplete and very often false, misleading, fictitious, mendacious - just dead wrong. The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up. In fact, the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual tax code. This will be a tough job, but members of both parties have expressed an interest in doing this, and I am prepared to join them. Look your best - who said love is blind? \\x0cSuccess in its highest and noblest form calls for peace of mind and enjoyment and happiness which come only to the man who has found the work that he likes best. I just think it is important that you realize , that you\\'re the best in the world. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican or whether you\\'re libertarian or whatever, you are the best. And we should not ever forget that. And when somebody does not do the job, we got to let them go. The best way out of a difficulty is through it. We can choose a future where we export more products and outsource fewer jobs. After a decade that was defined by what we bought and borrowed, we\\'re getting back to basics, and doing what America has always done best: We\\'re making things again. Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self- satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable. My aim is to put down on paper what I see and what I feel in the best and simplest way. Excellence is the best deterrent to racism or sexism. There\\'s a victory, and defeat the first and best of victories, the lowest and worst of defeats which each man gains or sustains at the hands not of another, but of himself. The best way to pay for a lovely moment is to enjoy it. A man\\'s friendships are one of the best measures of his worth. In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy\\'s country whole and intact to shatter and destroy it is not so good. Cynical realism is the intelligent man\\'s best excuse for doing nothing in an intolerable situation. When a place gets crowded enough to require ID\\'s, social collapse is not far away. It is time to go elsewhere. The best thing about space travel is that it made it possible to go elsewhere. For a long time now I have tried simply to write the best I can. Sometimes I have good luck and write better than I can. Life doesn\\'t require that we be the best, only that we try our best. God is not on the side of the big battalions, but on the side of those who shoot best. \\x0cNever argue at the dinner table, for the one who is not hungry always gets the best of the argument. It has always been my belief that a man should do his best, regardless of how much he receives for his services, or the number of people he may be serving or the class of people served. I was raised to believe that excellence is the best deterrent to racism or sexism. And that\\'s how I operate my life. Compromise is the best and cheapest lawyer. Your purpose is to make your audience see what you saw, hear what you heard, feel what you felt. Relevant detail, couched in concrete, colorful language, is the best way to recreate the incident as it happened and to picture it for the audience. The best way to sell yourself to others is first to sell the others to yourself. A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of. One thing is sure. We have to do something. We have to do the best we know how at the moment... If it doesn\\'t turn out right, we can modify it as we go along. The statistics on sanity are that one out of every four Americans is suffering from some form of mental illness. Think of your three best friends. If they\\'re okay, then it\\'s you. That is what we are supposed to do when we are at our best - make it all up - but make it up so truly that later it will happen that way. The best is the enemy of the good. Marilyn Monroe wasn\\'t even her real name, Charles Manson isn\\'t his real name, and now, I\\'m taking that to be my real name. But what\\'s real? You can\\'t find the truth, you just pick the lie you like the best. The optimist thinks this is the best of all possible worlds. The pessimist fears it is true. The best activities for your health are pumping and humping. In this world you\\'ve just got to hope for the best and prepare for the worst and take whatever God sends. The best government is a benevolent tyranny tempered by an occasional assassination. \\x0cEveryone enjoys doing the kind of work for which he is best suited. In a completely rational society, the best of us would be teachers and the rest of us would have to settle for something else. All significant truths are private truths. As they become public they cease to become truths they become facts, or at best, part of the public character or at worst, catchwords. The best way to be boring is to leave nothing out. We would all like to vote for the best man but he is never a candidate. Our best successes often come after our greatest disappointments. And while the law of competition may be sometimes hard for the individual, it is best for the race, because it ensures the survival of the fittest in every department. Don\\'t let the fear of the time it will take to accomplish something stand in the way of your doing it. The time will pass anyway we might just as well put that passing time to the best possible use. Do right. Do your best. Treat others as you want to be treated. Among the natural rights of the colonists are these: First a right to life, secondly to liberty, and thirdly to property together with the right to defend them in the best manner they can. The best government is that which teaches us to govern ourselves. Just do the best you can. No one can do more than that. The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today. The death of my father is probably the biggest thing that I ever faced. Daddy and I were best friends. The genius of the United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures, nor in its ambassadors or authors or colleges, or churches, or parlors, nor even in its newspapers or inventors, but always most in the common people. The best scientist is open to experience and begins with romance - the idea that anything is possible. \\x0cOur worldly successes cannot be guaranteed, but our ability to achieve spiritual success is entirely up to us, thanks to the grace of God. The best advice I know is to give is to give those worldly things your best but never your all - reserve the ultimate hope for the only one who can grant it.  The best way to predict the future is to invent it. Which government is the best? The one that teaches us to govern ourselves. About astrology and palmistry: they are good because they make people vivid and full of possibilities. They are communism at its best. Everybody has a birthday and almost everybody has a palm. Luck marches with those who give their very best. I find that the best way to do things is to constantly move forward and to never doubt anything and keep moving forward, if you make a mistake say you made a mistake. In art the best is good enough. One cannot develop taste from what is of average quality but only from the very best. The best cure for the body is a quiet mind. The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. Best of all is it to preserve everything in a pure, still heart, and let there be for every pulse a thanksgiving, and for every breath a song. You teach best what you most need to learn. It is always the best policy to speak the truth, unless, of course, you are an exceptionally good liar. To refrain from imitation is the best revenge. Yes\\'m, old friends is always best, \\'less you can catch a new one that\\'s fit to make an old one out of. The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity. There is an infinite difference between a little wrong and just right, between fairly good and the best, between mediocrity and superiority. I just want to do what I do best, and that\\'s fight. I love it. No one can really honestly be the very best, no one. Some of my best leading men have been dogs and horses. \\x0cYou must accept that you might fail then, if you do your best and still don\\'t win, at least you can be satisfied that you\\'ve tried. If you don\\'t accept failure as a possibility, you don\\'t set high goals, you don\\'t branch out, you don\\'t try - you don\\'t take the risk. You always want to quit while you are ahead. You don\\'t want to be like a fighter who stays too long in the ring until you\\'re not performing at your best.  To be successful in real estate, you must always and consistently put your clients\\' best interests first. When you do, your personal needs will be realized beyond your greatest expectations. Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art. The 1st period is won by the best technician. The 2nd period is won by the kid in the best shape. The 3rd period is won by the kid with the biggest heart. There\\'s a lot of great movies that have won the Academy Award, and a lot of great movies that haven\\'t. You just do the best you can. I believe the best service to the child is the service closest to the child, and children who are victims of neglect, abuse, or abandonment must not also be victims of bureaucracy. They deserve our devoted attention, not our divided attention. The trite saying that honesty is the best policy has met with the just criticism that honesty is not policy. The real honest man is honest from conviction of what is right, not from policy. We must stop thinking of the individual and start thinking about what is best for society. If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn\\'t you feel that way now that he\\'s President Obama? You know there\\'s something wrong with the kind of job he\\'s done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him. The best thinking has been done in solitude. The worst has been done in turmoil. To study the abnormal is the best way of understanding the normal. A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained in arms, is the best most natural defense of a free country. \\x0cMake the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens. Massachusetts children cannot only lead the nation in test scores, they can be competitive with the best in the world. And the gap in achievement among races can virtually disappear. I want you to remember when our White House reflected the best of who we are, not the worst of what Europe has become. The strength and power and goodness of America has always been based on the strength and power and goodness of our communities, our families, our faiths. That is the bedrock of what makes America, America. In our best days, we can feel the vibrancy of America\\'s communities, large and small. I have long since come to believe that people never mean half of what they say, and that it is best to disregard their talk and judge only their actions. Nearly all the best things that came to me in life have been unexpected, unplanned by me. The best way to destroy the capitalist system is to debauch the currency. Achievement is not always success, while reputed failure often is. It is honest endeavor, persistent effort to do the best possible under any and all circumstances. Baseball was, is and always will be to me the best game in the world. The things we know best are the things we haven\\'t been taught. Surround yourself with good people. Whether they\\'re the best or not, people are capable of learning if they\\'ve got good hearts and they\\'re good souls. Always Do Your Best. Your best is going to change from moment to moment it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self- judgment, self-abuse and regret. Cheerfulness is the best promoter of health and is as friendly to the mind as to the body. The best weapon of a dictatorship is secrecy, but the best weapon of a democracy should be the weapon of openness. \\x0cI think what makes our marriage work amid all the glare is that my husband is my best friend. He inspires everything in my life and enables me to do the best that I can. I want to hang out with him more than anyone. Now I see the secret of making the best person: it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth. Laughter is not a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is the best ending for one. What we call wisdom is the result of all the wisdom of past ages. Our best institutions are like young trees growing upon the roots of the old trunks that have crumbled away. The best way of removing negativity is to laugh and be joyous. Every year of my life I grow more convinced that it is wisest and best to fix our attention on the beautiful and the good, and dwell as little as possible on the evil and the false. Men are like wine - some turn to vinegar, but the best improve with age. I owe my success to having listened respectfully to the very best advice, and then going away and doing the exact opposite. With my wife I don\\'t get no respect. I made a toast on her birthday to \\'the best woman a man ever had.\\' The waiter joined me. The best and safest thing is to keep a balance in your life, acknowledge the great powers around us and in us. If you can do that, and live that way, you are really a wise man. The Lord gets his best soldiers out of the highlands of affliction. The best argument I know for an immortal life is the existence of a man who deserves one. Set up another case bartender! The best thing for a case of nerves is a case of Scotch. Toleration is the best religion. Speak when you are angry - and you\\'ll make the best speech you\\'ll ever regret. Stubborn and ardent clinging to one\\'s opinion is the best proof of stupidity. The best books... are those that tell you what you know already. Genius always gives its best at first prudence, at last. \\x0cDo what you love to do and give it your very best. Whether it\\'s business or baseball, or the theater, or any field. If you don\\'t love what you\\'re doing and you can\\'t give it your best, get out of it. Life is too short. You\\'ll be an old man before you know it. That best portion of a man\\'s life, his little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and love. I lead no party I follow no leader. I have given the best part of my life to careful study of Islam, its law and polity, its culture, its history and its literature. I don\\'t want to do business with those who don\\'t make a profit, because they can\\'t give the best service. No man who worships education has got the best out of education... Without a gentle contempt for education no man\\'s education is complete. Use what talents you possess the woods would be very silent if no birds sang there except those that sang best. A woman\\'s best protection is a little money of her own. People who lean on logic and philosophy and rational exposition end by starving the best part of the mind. The most basic question is not what is best, but who shall decide what is best. I don\\'t know why, it\\'s the same reason why you like some music and you don\\'t like others. There\\'s something about it that you like. Ultimately I don\\'t find it\\'s in my best interests to try and analyze it, since it\\'s fundamentally emotional. I am not a perfect servant. I am a public servant doing my best against the odds. As I develop and serve, be patient. God is not finished with me yet. Of all the home remedies, a good wife is best. Everywhere I go, I\\'m asked if I think the universities stifle writers. My opinion is that they don\\'t stifle enough of them. There\\'s many a best seller that could have been prevented by a good teacher. These things bring you to reality as to how fragile you are at the same moment you are doing something that nobody else is able to do. The same moment that you are seen as the best, the fastest and somebody that cannot be touched, you are enormously fragile. \\x0cI was never one to patiently pick up broken fragments and glue them together again and tell myself that the mended whole was as good as new. What is broken is broken - and I\\'d rather remember it as it was at its best than mend it and see the broken places as long as I lived. Goals provide the energy source that powers our lives. One of the best ways we can get the most from the energy we have is to focus it. That is what goals can do for us concentrate our energy. The deferring of anger is the best antidote to anger. Man, being reasonable, must get drunk the best of life is but intoxication.'"
